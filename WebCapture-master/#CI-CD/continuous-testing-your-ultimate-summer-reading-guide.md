Let's face it--if you clicked and started reading an article on Continuous Testing summer reading, your company is probably practicing or moving towards DevOps. And if you want to help ensure that your DevOps initiative delivers quantifiable and tangible business value, you must read this book. It's the culmination of four years of rigorous research designed to measure software delivery performance--and what drives it. People interested in Continuous Testing will want to pay particularly close attention to the book's findings on what test automation practices predict IT performance.

The past few years have brought a sea change in the way applications are architected, developed, and consumed--increasing both the complexity of testing and the business impact of software failures. How can software testing professionals keep pace with modern application delivery, given the trends that impact both architectures (cloud, microservices, and APIs) and processes (DevOps, agile, and continuous delivery)? This is where Continuous Testing comes in. This article explores what Continuous Testing really involves, how it's different than test automation, and what best practices are essential for addressing the 3 core elements of Continuous Testing.

We all know that low test automation rates are a fundamental challenge to continuous testing. This article explores other critical challenges that are commonly overlooked: the "not my problem" problem, overwhelming amounts of data being generated, constant OS updates (for mobile testing), and the unexpected time suck of open source tools.

TechWell and QASymphony partnered on a survey of testers and QA leaders to assess current levels of test automation, how quickly its implementation is progressing, and how enterprise organizations are harnessing test automation to meet their specific needs. Read the report to learn how your scope and levels of test automation compare to your peers, see the top challenges to sustainable test automation, and discover how these challenges vary across automation maturity levels.

This article explains what continuous testing looks like in the context of mobile development. Challenges like app store gatekeepers, countless OS versions/device types/hardware features, etc., and limited visibility into errors add new layers of complexity to already-challenging processes. To help readers combat these challenges, the article concludes with tips for achieving the right balance between speed and quality, tackling fragmentation, and gaining deep visibility into application performance.

Speed is certainly important in the development environment today, but, you can't just focus on speed without considering the risk of delivering poor end-user experience. Assessing the risk of every release candidate before deploying it in production is critical for ensuring that the end-user experience is not compromised. This report looks at some of the challenges organizations are facing when it comes to assessing risk, the benefits of continuous testing, and best practices to ensure that high-risk release candidates do not proceed through the delivery pipeline.

This article focuses on how to achieve the fast and frequent feedback loops that DevOps requires. It presents several different types of feedback loops, then provides tips for getting unit tests, regression tests, and user acceptance tests to deliver the fast feedback you need.
