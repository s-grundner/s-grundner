# A Quality Discussion

The quality discussion is a hard one to have - within teams, and within an organization. Lyssa Adkins, author of _Coaching Agile Teams_, sent out this inspirational quote along with the following question in one of her newsletters.

> Quote: Quality is not an act, it is a habit - Aristotle

"If your product was dinner, would you serve it to your children?"

I wrote back to her and we had a great discussion. I suggested that it wasn't the best analogy because I often gave my children peanut butter sandwiches if I was in a hurry. I know give my grandchildren macaroni and cheese (because it's their favourite) which is not a high quality meal by any standards.

We refined the question to be more like this ….

"If your product was dinner, would you serve it to your in-laws or maybe your boss?

Another question that you may want to ask your team is …

"Do your customers actually like using your product, or do they just tolerate it?"

These questions won't necessarily answer your quality question, but they can get the conversation started. On agile teams, quality is everyone's job so start by having the discussion. Don't ignore it.
