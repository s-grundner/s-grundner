# What is Quality?

#### **Definition**

Working as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer for many years I've always been thinking, that:

> **Quality is a subjective measure of a correlation between a product or service and an ethalon. And the ethalon is defined by requirements, standards and common sense.**  
(Russian: субьективная мера соответствия продукта или услуги эталону, определяемому требованиями, стандартом или здравым смыслом)

Very complex and uncertain definition, right?  
Which is not valid for me anymore.

Now I think, that:

> **Quality -- is an execution level.**  
(Russian: класс исполнения)

How well is a good or service at execution level? How well it executes?  
If it's great at execution level, then it's recognized as a quality one and it goes to Production.

#### Why do we chase for Quality?

The thing, that you can't sell anything, you can't make a business on something, that badly executes. Because business -- is a multiplication result of an idea on execution level, multiplication result of an idea on Quality.

> Ideas worth nothing unless executed.  
Ideas are just multiplier. Execution worth millions.

> For example:

> Awful idea = -1  
Weak idea = 1  
So-so idea = 5  
Good idea = 10  
Great idea = 15  
Brilliant idea = 20

> No execution = $1  
Weak execution = $1000  
So-so execution = $10,000  
Good execution = $100,000  
Great execution = $1000,000  
Brilliant execution = $10,000,000

> To make a business, you need to multiply two (idea on execution).

That's why Quality matters so much: it makes a value for the business to trade. Quality defines [how much business worth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo).

That's why Quality Assurance Departments exist.  
And that's why [Quality is not a trade-off](https://medium.com/@alexeyhimself/quality-is-not-a-trade-off-6018ebf7bd4f#.hxmwiypcd).

Thank you!
