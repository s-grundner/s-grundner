**quality**  
_noun _| qual-i-ty

: how good or bad something is  
: a characteristic or feature that someone or something has : something that can be noticed as a part of a person or thing  
: a high level of value or excellence

Quality is something we all desire in life… in the food we eat, the music we listen to, our relationships, and the products we buy. In software, quality is a lot of things… performance, reliability, aesthetics, ease of use, security, and more. But how do you achieve "quality" in software? How do you ensure your team is setup for success to build the highest quality product possible, a product your customers will value and be proud to use? Quality is in the culture, and it is dependent on many elements of the business.

#### **Quality is in Communication**

You can't build quality software if your team isn't communicating effectively. If you're constantly asking questions that have already been answered, or always looking for information and can't find it, there is a problem in communication. Communicate efficiently and effectively and your ecosystem will be easier to navigate and find the information you need.

#### **Quality is in the Process**

You should enjoy the process. Keep it simple and build from there. If your process is bloated and broken, chances are your software will be too. Start with a lean process and scale it as necessary.

#### **Quality is in the Team**

Don't just hire smart people, hire quality-focused people and give them empowerment and ownership. A culture of quality comes from leadership and a quality-centric team. With the right people in place, quality will happen.

#### **Quality is in the Tools**

Every team works differently, and there's not one set of tools to guarantee "quality". Always use the right tool for the job. The key here is to be open to change. Is your issue tracking tool falling short or causing frustration within the team? Try something new. The right tools are necessary to have the right process and communication in place, which leads to a process you can enjoy.

When quality is built into culture, your product and team will both benefit. You'll find you're working smarter, not harder… and in the end, you'll have happier customers.
