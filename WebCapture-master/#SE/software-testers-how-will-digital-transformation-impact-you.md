Software testers already recognize that we're facing a sea change in the way applications are architected, developed, and released. At this year's [StarWest](https://starwest.techwell.com/program/virtual-conference), every software testing session, training, and lunch table discussion mentioned how digital transformation initiatives such as DevOps and Continuous Delivery are disrupting the testing community.

It's no longer a matter of _if_ testing must change, but _how_.

Enter Accelerate 2017, _Continuous Testing: Transforming Testing for DevOps_. The conference, which kicked off on Monday, October 16, was dedicated to helping software testers navigate the path forward. There were deep dives into the topic with 10 keynotes, 6 hands-on workshops, 24 track talks, over 30 speakers, and a record number of registrants from around the world.

Couldn't make it to Accelerate 2017? You can still catch the keynotes. We broadcasted a number of sessions that provide the CxO perspective on how business expectations are changing--followed by insights into how software testing will evolve in response to these new expectations.

Here's a preview of a few keynotes that you won't want to miss:

## What CxOs Really Think About Testing

Want to know what CxOs _really_ think about software testing? Get the inside perspective from [Todd Pierce,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/topierce/) Tricentis Growth Advisory Board member, Healthcare and Life Sciences Board Member and Executive, and former Chief Digital Officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The truth is, most CIOs don't think about testing at all until a high-profile application problem hits the headlines, impacting brand reputation, personal reputation, and the bottom line. The general consensus is that "testing is boring"--but what does this mean for the testing organization that ultimate reports up to that CxO?

In this keynote address, Todd provides insight into topics such as:

  * What's really changing with digital transformation and what's at stake?

  * What do CIOs want from the software testing organization, and what are they willing to do to get it?

  * From a software delivery perspective, what should be considered the new normal, and how should software professionals prepare?

## CIO Panel: The Digital Imperative for Software Delivery Transformation

Most testers are already feeling the impacts of digital transformation initiatives such as DevOps adoption and scaling Agile. From delivery speed to tooling, to team structure, to application architectures, almost everything has changed. But if you manage to catch up, don't get too comfortable. According to top CIOs, we're just getting started.

In this session, CIOs from Etihad, BBVA, FieslandCampina, and Mars explore the digital transformation initiatives currently on the CIO agenda--and why software delivery process transformation is key to their ultimate success. The panel discussion moves the discussion beyond the buzzwords by looking at specific examples of digital transformation initiatives already in the works.

## Digital Transformation: Navigating the Future of Testing

Just as smartphones have revolutionized the way we communicate, digital transformation initiatives like Agile, DevOps, and the cloud have forever changed the way that we test. We've already made previously-unimaginable leaps forward--but digital transformation is only increasing in both speed and scope.

All signs indicate that the next wave of innovation will be driven by AI, robotics, big data, and predictive analytics. As a tester, you will face the challenge of testing applications that are simply beyond the scope of our current approaches. But you will also be able to take advantage of a new generation of testing technologies--enabling you to reinvent your testing process for the digital future.

In this keynote, [Wolfgang Platz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfgang-platz-2a68681b/), Tricentis Founder and Chief Strategy Officer, shares his vision of what software testing will look like in the digital future. Platz explores how enterprise application architectures and associated delivery models are changing, discusses how testing must evolve to address these changes, and outlines what testers can (and must) do to successfully navigate the road ahead.
