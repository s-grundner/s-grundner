Scheduling software can be an excellent way to improve a manger's efficiency. Preparing manual schedules can be a time-consuming and complex task. By harnessing technology for the task, schedules can be prepared and distributed in less time, freeing managers for more mission-critical tasks. Not all scheduling systems are the same, however, so here are eight features that you should look for when choosing your new scheduling software.

  * **Optimized for mobile:** Attempting to interact with a non-responsive web page can be frustrating if not impossible. Ensure that your scheduling system features a responsive design. [Developing native apps for iOS and Android](http://www.phasealpha.com/Our-Services/Mobile-Apps) is even better as they will automatically adjust for the device's screen size.
  * **More than one manager login: **Although scheduling may be the normal responsibility of one manager, there may be times when this manager is unavailable. Having multiple logins with the correct permissions is a definite plus, especially if you operate 24/7.
  * **Ability to integrate with payroll: **Integrating your scheduling and payroll systems can improve efficiency. At a minimum, your scheduling system should be able to export a file to be imported into payroll. This can reduce the amount of data that will need to be entered manually into the payroll system, which often improves accuracy.
  * **Ability to handle more than one job per employee: **In some environments, employees may be assigned to more than one job during the same workweek. Scheduling systems should offer the ability to define more than one role for an employee. 
  * **Private until published: **The manager should be able to complete the schedule before employees can view it. Only after the manager determines that the schedule is accurate and complete and makes it public will employees be able to see their schedules.
  * **Automatically notifies employees of schedule: **The system should send an automatic notification via text or email when the new schedule has been published as well as whenever there is a change to an existing schedule.
  * **Track hours automatically: **Your scheduling system should automatically keep track of the number of hours each employee is scheduled. The system should allow you to set the maximum hours for each employee; it should warn you if you exceed that maximum but have an override option.
  * **Log changes: **A scheduling system should have the ability to maintain a log of schedule changes, including who made the change and when it was made.
