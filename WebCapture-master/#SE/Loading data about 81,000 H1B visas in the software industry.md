You're looking at a histogram of salaries given to H1B workers in the software industry. You can filter by year, job title, and state.

All data is from [h1bdata.info](http://h1bdata.info/)

### React + d3.js

This site was built with React and d3.js. React is great for handling user inputs and keeping everything in sync. D3.js is great for showing data. Together they make for a wonderful combination.

I'm releasing a short eBook on how all this works soon. You should tell me if you want it.

Hi, I'm Swizec Teller.

I built these graphs because I'm about to apply for an H1B visa, and I wanted to see what to expect. What astounded me most was that Engineers make $20k/year more than programmers.

> Average H1B salaries in 2014 Engineer: $87k Developer: $74k Programmer: $61k Don't call yourself a programmer <http://t.co/Dlwnm4nCxh>
