Writing buggy code is what all programmers do, regardless of their skills or experience. Sounds frustrating? Well, you can actually earn a lot if you can do debugging!

Debugging is the process by which developers remove buggy code. Most developers spend more than half of their time fixing bugs that they shouldn't have written in the first place.

How does one find and remove buggy code? A great solution is to track your work by broadcasting the process of web development. What's more, you can earn some additional money on this, just like [Backmeupplz from Vancouver Canada](https://www.liveedu.tv/backmeupplz/RdD71-how-to-create-a-url-shortener-nodejs/).

### Who Is a Bug Developer?

> If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. -- _Edsger Dijkstra_

**_Bug Developers_** tend to write buggy code. They are more inclined towards completing the assigned work and lack the personal and professional touch to write bug-free code in the first place. Sound harsh? Well, don't be demoralized, as it is not the only reason behind writing buggy code.

Many developers just lack the experience to write high-quality code with minimal bugs. It takes time and patience to be good at your craft and writing buggy code, in the beginning, is a part of the journey.

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. -- Brian Kernighan 

Alright, you may now be thinking that no developer in the world writes clean code out of the gate. Well, that's true. However, developers at the beginning of their career tend to write more buggy code.

What makes developers write buggy code? Let's explore this.

### From Bug Developer to Software Engineer

There is always a transition phase. Do you remember the first program you coded? The code can be a simple, "Hello, world" program or a program that draws a circle on the screen. Now, compare it to your present skill and how much you have improved. Amazing, right?

Now you can handle real world development. It is complex and unforgiving. Requirements and deadlines need to be met. Requirements are misunderstood and so on.

You are more of a "bug developer" than an actual software engineer in the beginning. It slowly fades out as you gain experience and skill. You can argue that there is no fundamental difference between the two. However, the significant difference between them is the knowledge, experience, and efficiency. And, that's good.

The transition period is mandatory, and every developer goes through it.

### Buggy Code Evasion: Is it Everywhere?

No. Even though the amount of bugs in code differ from one developer to another, no developer or software engineer writes bug-free code. The efficiency only increases over time, making them better at what they do.

### How Long Does It Take to Improve My Skills?

There is no time-frame to achieve excellence in what you do. It takes a long time to transition from being a bug developer to a software engineer who writes excellent code.

We have already mentioned that developing software is complex. In addition to that, the rapid change in the market means the evolution of existing technologies and the introduction of new ones.

Every five years, the developer needs to learn new skills to keep up with the changing market, which in itself is a challenging feat. It's essential to be up-to-date with current trends in the industry. That's why even an experienced developer keeps learning with practical project tutorials.

So, is there a time-frame that you can target to become good? It takes around 5-6 years to become a better developer and write better code. By that time, a developer gains experience over multiple projects or domains. The key factor here is the experience that a developer gains over the years. In the end, the situation, skill, and experience of the person play an important role.

### How to Start My Bug Developer Career?

By streaming your experience, you are only benefiting yourself. You can come back and check your mistakes. Other developers can also guide you and help you improve faster. Also, streaming projects online can help you build an online live portfolio which in-turn can help you get the attention of clients.

Writing buggy code is not bad. It is just a part of the journey. Let us know in the comments section below when you are going to start your journey.We are listening.
