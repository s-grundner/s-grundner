Nowadays, most IT companies follow a particular method to come up with software development strategies and to sustain the timely delivery of the software with an aim of fulfilling client requirements. For a person working in the IT domain, Agile software methodology is not a very rare occurrence.

## **Why Is Agile So Renowned? **

Agile is a software development strategy that includes a set of principles and methods that depict the progression of the requirements and solutions through the proper alliance of self-systematized and cross-functional teams. This method includes certain iterative and progressive procedures that aim at product compliance and client contentment for a quick delivery of software services.

SDLC consists of thousands of traditional methodologies such as Waterfall, Big Bang, Iterative, the V-Model, and so on, most of them focusing on the software development process with a predictive and analytic approach. They consist of thorough planning to estimate the upcoming tasks that should be delivered in the near future. The estimation of the tasks depends on the scrutiny of necessities. On the other hand, Agile software development approaches adaptive features that cope with the modification of the product needs. It elucidates the features of the future tasks instead of predicting them.

## **How Agile Works**

By adapting a tricky concept, Agile methodology facilitates the entire software development and delivery process. It divides the entire work into smaller time frames that work iteratively. These iterations usually work for small durations where the cross-functional teams work in diverse areas of a project such as planning, requirements analysis, testing, building, designing, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing. The frames are related to each other and maintain a progressive approach and the final frame consists of all the features that the customers want.

This iteration repeats for two to three times, which helps in managing and operating the new projects in an optimized manner. It also helps in altering and updating the existed projects so that they suit the best with the needs. After the iteration process is completed, the manufactured product is delivered to the clients and stakeholders.

## **Objectives of Agile**

Agile software development was first explained in the Agile Manifesto in February 2001 by a group of software developers. The Manifesto focuses on certain principles. They are as follows:

  * Individuals and interactions.
  * Working software.
  * Customer collaboration.
  * Responding to change.

Later, it was adopted by many IT companies for its flexible and incremental goals, such as:

  * Adaptive strategy building.
  * Flexibility to adopt and accept change.
  * Fragmenting works for the proper implementation of the projects.
  * Collaboration between all teams.
  * Progressive development.
  * Rapid delivery of the product.
  * Fulfillment of client requirements. 

The adoption of Agile Methodology helps focus on the smallest parts of the entire project. Each part evolves to another only after the client approval, which facilitates the software development process and helps you deliver the project within the estimated time.
