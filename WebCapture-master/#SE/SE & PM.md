## Mission Statement (Bernd Brügge)

Developing and managing software is always on the move. Continuously growing complexity and shortened development cycles require high flexibility, new ideas and the courage to challenge traditional approaches. This is what we aim in our research projects and teaching courses.
Together with industrial and research partners, we develop, evaluate and implement new methods and solutions to support practitioners in dealing with software engineering today's challenges.
 
Teaching and training students in topics around software engineering is our main concern. We offer lectures, seminars and practical courses in real projects and with real customers, following a learning by doing approach. Our students can prepare themselves for professional life, gain much theoretical and practical knowledge and have a lot of fun.

Diagram is (Sometimes) Worth Ten Thousand Words.
During my research starting stage, I'm trying to get myself better understanding of state-of-the-art in software engineering area. The diagram below is first one of this series. It contains the basic research topics in software maintenance/evolution area of software engineering. To better understand on each small topic on this diagram, I will also draw hierarchy diagram on each small topic to discover the related work, research approaches, etc.

## @Design Patterns

⁃ Test drive everything.
⁃ Find what varies and encapsulate it.
⁃ Design to interfaces.

## @TDD

## Project Management

## ten lines or less coding theory

I do not subscribe to the "fewest lines automatically wins" philosophy but I do love to be concise in my code thus my love for "ten lines or less".

- Code is more often read than written so... "Readability counts"
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- The more concise your code is, the easier it is to understand and to debug but it must be readable
- Having clean lines is just as important as having few lines.
- Breaking your work into functions and methods will makes your code more understand and reusable.
