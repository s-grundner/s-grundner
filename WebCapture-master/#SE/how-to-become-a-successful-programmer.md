Programming is a field where interest is not enough to succeed. You have to be passionate, but also constantly learning more and more about programming. **Simply being interested in programming isn't enough to succeed **\- we work like mad.

Programming is a profession with no limits, so to become a successful programmer you have to **think beyond the limits you've been told exist**. In the starting stages of a programmer's career, they'll face many challenges and some of them will give up, and only a very few will see the struggle through, do the hard work, and become a master in their field.

## Steps to Becoming a Successful Programmer

### 1\. Willingness to Learn New Technologies

What we have **learned and implemented **can quickly become obsolete as **technology is always changing.** So, as a programmer, you just have to _**update your skills accordingly**_ and stay up to date. When a new technology comes on the market, it's typically made up of a few process and syntax changes, but **_the logic is the same_** so you can grasp it very fast.

### 2\. Debugging Skills

_**Programmers create code,**_ but when the software does not work as expected, the programmer should be able to root out the problem quickly and effectively.

So, instead of making changes to all your code,_** make a proper flow document while creating your program so that you can investigate your code very quickly and find the issue as soon as possible**_. By making a proper document, you can debug your program quickly without wasting much time.

### 3\. Problem-Solving Skills

When an average programmer gets a project/module, they just start coding. But successful programmers_** try to find the root of the problem**_ that their code is addressing and inform their team leader or project leader. Because sometimes after a project requirement is documented and the project is started, or even after it's completed, we get some issue in the project. So _**find the issue before it arises**_.

Also, find a way to solve the issue very quickly.

### 4\. Passion for the Work

Your job time may be_** nine to five**_ but when you have a passion for doing the job, don't just walk away when the workday is over. _**Work until your work is done**_. I don't mean to say that if you are not getting the solution then you should sit around frustrated the whole day, but if you're getting close, then just complete it.

Your manager or the higher-ups will appreciate your work, and when you find a good environment _**your passion will increase.**_

_**Also, don't just sit around when there is no work. Try to build some new application like a game, puzzle, chatting app, etc.,** _which will help to make you more passionate about your work.

### 5\. Grace Under Fire

Programming can be a stressful profession due to tight deadlines. And then there are those times we can't seem to get anything working. A poor programmer**_ just freezes up_** and stops working. But a great programmer handles the stressful situation calmly and just keeps on working.

### 6\. Laziness... I Mean Efficiency! 

When there are a lot of tasks and time is **running out to complete your project,** then only the lazy programmer will find the better and quickest solution for completing the project because he knows very well how to work less and do more.

If you want to find the best way to do something then just ask the lazy person; chances are the lazy person will find the best, quickest, and most efficient way to do it because the_** lazy person always tries to find a more efficient way.**_

### 7\. Ability to Handle Failure

As a programmer, you will rarely have success on the first try, so failure is almost a certainty. So take this as a challenge rather than as a sign of defeat. Having patience and_** persistence is very important to having success in programming.**_

### 8\. Willingness to Research

A programming language is just part of the picture. **A good and successful programmer always tries to make code which works for their employers and helps to solve business problems. **And, sometimes, this requires you to do a little digging.

### 9\. Teamwork Mentality

As you are a developer, you always work with a team because with the help of team members like the designers, business staff, analysts, and sales staff _**you can achieve your desired results very effectively**_.

You will never meet your goals until you work with the team.

### 10\. A Business Perspective

It is easy to work as a programmer in an IT company, but the _**ideal programmer always focuses on business goals.**_ This allows you to move beyond just working on application ideas that get handed down from on high. **Only a business focused programmer can suggest ideas** for a new project that may improve efficiency and operations.
