In today's competitive world, to develop a software or an application that exclusively meets specific needs for your business is a necessity for survival. Every business is unique. Therefore, its requirements are different. Many companies use off-the-shelf software that is built while considering the common needs of businesses. This off-the-shelf software helps you to some extent but can't fulfill all your requirements. Here, your business needs custom software development.

Let's look into an example everyone can relate to: social networking applications. If a person wants to look for a job, he or she would go to LinkedIn. If a person wants to share personal thoughts with the public, he or she would use Facebook. If a person wants to chat with an individual or a group, he or she would use Whatsapp, and for discussions over forums, he or she would use Quora. Each of these applications provides a fantastic way to keep in touch with others, and they each provide unique features for different domains.

## What Is Custom Software Development?

Custom software development is the process of designing a software that is specifically developed for the user or a group of users within an organization. Custom software is made to ensure that all your particular preferences and requirements are accommodated.

Like any software development process, the custom software development process also goes through several different stages to get the final product. It includes a collection of requirements, research, changes management, risk management, development, quality assurance, intermediate deliveries, and reporting.

## Why Custom Software Development?

First of all, custom software is built based on your specific requirements. It is scalable and helps you fulfill your business requirements with the ever-changing trends and evolving technology.

In this competitive era, everyone is trying hard to move from better to the best. Here, it may help to address a few concerns and facilitate business in excelling.

  * **Get the best features within budget.** Choose the features you need the most to grow your business instead of paying for all the features, some of which may be of least importance to your business needs.
  * **Decide the outlook of the software according to the target consumers and platforms.** This point is the foremost priority when you need to build a global application. Amazon and Ebay can be the best examples for incorporating this feature.
  * **Integration of pre-packaged software with your existing systems may not be seamless.** With custom software, you can design the application keeping in mind the existing systems and applications.
  * **Be the first to overcome a technical challenge** instead of waiting for the provider to update their packaged software.
  * **Get customized reports** of specific events.

In custom software development, development starts with the core essential features and then new features or functions can be added later at any time. The product is built keeping in mind that changes can be made easily according to the evolving requirements of business.

## Cons of Custom Software Development

As customized software requires significantly more resources to design, it comes with a high amount of costs and risks. Off-the-shelf software can afford a low price point because the cost is being distributed among different users. Identifying new needs during the development process isn't uncommon, though it results in added costs as more development time and effort is required.

## How Should Customer Software Development Be?

  * The most desirable software development company will provide **quality software development services** and has **trained and expert developers** with experience.
  * Consequently, the company should provide **scalable services**.
  * A company that provides **cloud-based services** is more desirable as it offers better flexibility and security.
  * The software development company should use **Agile methodologies and have their priorities straight.**
