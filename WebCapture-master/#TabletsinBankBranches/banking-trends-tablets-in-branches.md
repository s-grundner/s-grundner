_Captured from [Banking Trends](http://www.customerxps.com/Clari5-Paperless-Branch-Banking.php)_

There was a time when almost all banking happened through these branches. Now with changing times, banking also happens through internet, mobiles, tablets, ATMs on and call-centers. This has led to a classic dilemma for the banks- If there are more customers in the bank without the proportionate increase in revenue from these footfalls, it simply adds to the cost of running the branches. On the other hand, the empty branches will weigh heavily on the balance sheet.
