[Huntington Bancshares Inc.](http://bankinnovation.net/tag/huntington/) is pumping up its tablet banking pilot.

After equipping branch bankers with tablets at about six of its branches, Huntington Bancshare Inc plans to expand its pilot effort to additional locations as a result of the positive feedback the bank has received to date.

"They create more of an open conversation," Jeff Dennes, Huntington's senior vice president and chief digital officer, tells **Bank Innovation** of the tablets being used in branch banking activities.

Huntington is one of but a handful of banks practicing ways to use tablets in banking sales today.

The "open conversation" tablets create is especially the case when it comes to account acquisition, Dennes said. Rather than providing customers with physical paperwork, bankers can offer up their tablets to consumers so that they can enter in their own data to enroll in a new product or service.

"Let the consumer do the work," Dennes says.

From the $56 billion regional bank's experience so far, Dennes says that tablet branch banking has created "more of an engaged experience" with consumers, which is a big win for the regional bank.

Huntington has about 660 branches in six states and is using a tablet app built by [Kony](http://www.kony.com/).

Tablet shipments continue to rocket higher. Tablet shipments have exceeded 10 million units per quarter since the beginning of 2011.

"We're actively working on it," Dennes says.
