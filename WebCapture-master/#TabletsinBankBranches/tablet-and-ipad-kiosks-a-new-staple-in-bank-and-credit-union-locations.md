A decline in traffic and usage at banks and credit unions has outlined a need for financial institutions to improve their services and transform branch locations to better engage with customers. The solution? [Secure tablet and iPad kiosks](https://www.bouncepad.com/original-shop/).

According to research and consulting company Novantas Inc., average teller transactions are expected to decline to 4,800 in 2016, compared to 5,600 transactions in 2013. One reason for the decline in traditional banking has been the shift in customer preference and behaviour toward online and mobile banking. This has made it critical for financial institutions to win over their customers the moment they step foot into a branch location, providing the same efficient -- and secure -- customer service and experience they receive digitally.

Here's how tablets and iPad kiosks are changing the way banks and credit unions look and feel today:

### **Identification Management**

According to an [Accenture report](http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Future-Identity-Banking.pdf), more than $1 billion a year is spent on identity management solutions in the U.S., with banks topping the list of investors. Security is - and will be - a priority for financial institutions and new technologies help streamline the identification process.

Banks and credit unions are using voice and facial recognition technologies to identify customers quickly, allowing them to simply access or open a new bank account, and even to make ATM withdrawals. Additionally, Palm vein recognition like Fujitsu's [PalmSecure](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/biometrics/palm-vein/palmsecure/), uses infrared light to scan veins in a user's palm. Fujitsu claims its technology is safer than fingerprint scans, with a false acceptance rate of 0.00008 percent and a false rejection rate of 0.01 percent. The technology has been deployed in Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, as well as Italy's UniCredit bank.

### **Self-Service**

Tablet and iPad kiosks can improve the user experience for the do-it-yourself customer; British bank Lloyds is providing quick access to personal account information, financial services and tools, as well as sign-up or enrolment for new programs. While these self-service stations provide users with a quick and convenient experience, banks and credit unions are provided with new avenues to connect and interact with their customers, as well as cross-sell and educate them on additional financial services.

### **Personalized Experience**

Redesigned branch locations are helping banks and credit unions lose the traditional glass counters to create more personalized, customer-friendly environments. Placing tablets and iPad desk stands on counter top locations, as well as in lounges throughout the branch, customers can comfortably engage with the tablet kiosks as they please. Employees are not beholden to a desk, enabling them to walk around and provide on-the-spot assistance when needed - similar to many of the telecommunication retail stores we see today.

Navy Federal Credit Union, one of the world's largest credit unions, [has been using iPad kiosks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/worlds-largest-credit-union-is-getting-bigger/2014/05/16/faed9d1a-dab3-11e3-bda1-9b46b2066796_story.html) to show members how to use its mobile app to make deposits, transfer money and check balances. Additionally, the organization has a designated kids area, where the tablets display games for entertainment, as well as educational content.
