Even as mobile banking adoption accelerates rapidly, bank customers say they still want the option of branch-banking, too. That's the message of a report issued in 2013 by Accenture, which found that 32% of U.S. bank customers use mobile banking at least once a month (half again as many as in 2012) but 50% of those same customers would change banks if their current bank's branches closed. So, what's a bank to do?

Although possible solutions are numerous and varied, one way to increase branch efficiency and foster customer service and loyalty (thereby maximizing branch profit) is to leverage mobile technology _inside_ the branch. If banks can utilize mobile devices (especially tablets) in a way that it makes mobile-savvy account holders more comfortable, it's even better.

**Lighten Up the Lobby**

Consumers today crave a personal touch and mobile technology can help banks provide it. "We see a real trend for customer-facing applications in the branch--for teller and platform functions to be tablet-enabled to get away from the teller and the green screen," says Randy A. Wardwell of mobile banking technology developer FPS-Gold.

According to his firm's research, customers like the idea of a tablet-equipped customer service representative (CSR) showing them what a bank has to offer in a casual, one-on-one setting, without a counter or desk intervening. In such a scenario, account holders might wait for their CSR in an area where they can have coffee and use secure Wi-Fi to check email, perhaps charging their phones while they wait. Once the CSR arrives, they sit together (in a private area) over a tablet to conduct their business. If a bank uses a lobby-tracking solution that supports tablets, CSRs can also receive alerts when a customer signs in, or if assistance waits exceed a pre-determined timeframe.

**Improve Customer Service and Sales: **Banks can leverage mobile transaction _data_, as well, and use it to enhance the branch experience. Mobile processing systems can harvest transaction data and a business intelligence solution can aggregate it with other data, and analyze it to provide a rich snapshot of account holder activity.

By knowing what transactions mobile customers are performing on their mobile phones, bank branches can better target their offers, educate customers to use mobile features they abandoned before completion, and otherwise help them gain value from their banking interactions. More global insights (based on activities account holders are performing on any channel) enables branches to engage in more targeted outreach to encourage branch interactions.

**Take Mobile on the Road: **Just about everyone has stood in line at an ATM (their bank's or someone else's) at a festival or other community gathering. Now, imagine if a bank had an ATM onsite at that event in a tent that offered shade, treats or toys to keep the kids occupied, and a CSR with a tablet that could sign up new customers and help existing ones. From looking up current loan rates at a housing fair to showing a curious craftsperson how those "mobile payment processors" work, having staff at a community event that can actually do something with a tablet is far more engaging than handing out flyers and free pens!

**Keep the Ideas Flowing**

These are three fairly "big" ideas, but there are many small ones that banks can adopt, as well. For example, banks could send personnel their schedules, allow them to request vacation times and transmit alerts to on-call staff when they are needed--all via mobile device. Referencing the lobby data-collection systems mentioned earlier, banks could send mobile alerts to management when an important customer signs in so they could personally greet them.

To keep branches relevant and streamline operations, banks should adopt the same technologies account holders are using in their daily activities. "Mobile is where everyone is headed," Wardell says. "Banks need to recognize the fact that for many people, everything they need is on a mobile device. They bank via mobile device, and they make mobile technology part of their daily experience. Branches should take the same approach."
