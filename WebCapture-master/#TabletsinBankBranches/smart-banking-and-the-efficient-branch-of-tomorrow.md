Technology has impacted virtually every aspect of American life, but perhaps nowhere has experienced change so unexpectedly as that once-stodgy pillar of Main Street, U.S.A.: the local bank branch.

During the Great Recession, over 3,000 branches closed, as many financial institutions lost money--and many customers lost trust in them. At the same time, online banking and the mobile apps revolution have made many elements of the normal banking experience--waiting in line for an available teller, talking to a branch manager for a loan application--feel positively quaint. In fact, by the end of 2014, an estimated 80 percent of customers were doing some version of self-service banking (viewing balances, tracking deposits, paying bills) each month.

Even as technology advances, one thing that hasn't changed is how people feel about their local bank branches. According to a 2012 Novantas study, 47 percent of U.S. banking customers equated legitimate financial operations with physical, brick-and-mortar institutions. Customers don't want today's bank branches to disappear; they just want them to meet their new financial needs.

**The New Branch Experience**

In order to retain old customers and attract tech-savvy new ones, today's bank branches have to be customer-centric, technologically advanced and more streamlined. Some are already up to speed. No longer stoic Greek Revival temples with deposit windows, these branches now offer a rich, interactive, multichannel experience that is relevant to the times and responsive to customer needs.

Ironically, much of the same technology that spawned online banking--things like Big Data and cloud computing, social media and mobility--is helping to transform branch banking. And Samsung Finance Services plays a leading role in this financial revolution.

The branch of tomorrow announces itself the moment you walk through the door. Where as once the only things to read were signs promoting rates and printed tri-folds on a counter, now Samsung flat screens--in a range of sizes, from single displays and wall mounts to entire video walls--immediately engage you, delivering a stream of financial news and relevant content designed by Samsung Smart Signage. Thanks to the company's MagicInfo software, banks can create and display everything from product information and promotional offers to real-time stock market activity and financial news.

Meanwhile, across the floor, a branch representative arrives to greet you with a Samsung tablet in hand, which offers instant access to your account, then provides a hard copy of your sensitive documents using a multifunction printer (MFP) that provides enhanced security. Need to speak with an off-site expert in financial planning, investments or mortgages? The representative can usher you into a private cubicle to connect you to the appropriate person via video conferencing.

**The Branch of the Future**

There is no denying that bank customers, young ones in particular, are growing more and more used to navigating the financial landscape on their own, and the industry is poised to leverage Samsung technologies that already allow for banking 24 hours a day.

A vision of this future has already emerged in some branches, where interactive Samsung kiosks equipped with tablets and Thin Client technology allow you to process paperless applications and automate a number of common bank transactions. From those kiosks you can also access your financial records, forecast future outlooks, run portfolio simulations and sign up for new services.

Still, many of the advances will happen behind the scenes, where activity-based working (ABW) has been gaining traction in the sector. With Samsung Smart Cloud Displays, financial institutions can create a secure computing environment, streamline processes across multiple locations and support a more mobile workforce that is armed with lightweight, powerful tablets to provide business-ready solutions.

Bank branches will continue to evolve as smart finance environments in the coming months. For financial institutions, this will mean increased operational efficiency, lower costs, more timely delivery of targeted information and enhanced customer engagement.

For those customers, it will mean an expansion of multichannel experiences and ever-higher levels of sophisticated services--a banking world where the time it takes to complete transactions that were once considered high-touch (i.e. getting a mortgage or a small business loan) will be measured in days instead of weeks.

Technically, your local bank branch still sits on Main Street. Technologically, it is racing toward the future.
