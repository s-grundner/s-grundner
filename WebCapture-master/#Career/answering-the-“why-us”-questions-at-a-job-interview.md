In the first blog of this series we looked at the "[Why you" questions](https://prismrecruitment.co.uk/management-consultancy-recruitment-questions-best-interview-answers/) you might encounter in a management consultancy job interview. We addressed the need to highlight professional instead of personal achievements (unless they are truly spectacular e.g. climbing Everest), focus on the skills you will bring to an interviewer's team and to show that you are honest and self-aware.

Once you have successfully answered the "Why you?" questions you will need to answer the equally tricky "Why us?" portion of the job interview. The key to success when answering these questions is **research**.

#### Question 1: What do you know about the company?

Purposefully vague, this interview question will draw on both your research and analysis skills. Repeat the company's "About Us" page and you've failed to interpret the question. You do not need to have read all the news articles or remember the Annual Report verbatim but you will need to identify key industry sectors and service lines, highlight current focus, future strategy/growth and where possible company ethos. Now, summarise your findings into one or two sentences and explain their appeal.

#### Question 2: Why do you want this job?

  * What is it that made you apply for this role? _(Please do not say money!!)_
  * Why did this job appeal to you?
  * What attributes and experience do you possess that make you believe you'd be good at this job?

#### Question 3: What are you looking for in a new position?

This is an easy one but with a twist: find elements from the job description which are relevant BUT don't simply replay them back or else you risk looking glib and insincere. Also make sure that the job does indeed have what you mention: so don't say you want a role focussed on delivery if a significant part is sales. Sounds obvious but it happens all the time!

#### Question 4: How did you hear about the position?

Whether a job board, referral, agency or via a company search does not matter, what your interviewer really wants to know is 'why did you apply?' Particularly, why this job above all others?

#### Question 5: What do you think we could do better or differently?

Here the adage 'flattery will get you everywhere' is not entirely true. This is a chance to demonstrate your sector/service line knowledge, your critical thinking and show how your fresh ideas would benefit the company. Think of it as a consulting freebie!

What have you heard of the company? What pipelines could they work on? How could you use your network to bring new business to the table? You don't need to give names or have a fully formed action plan but this is a chance to present your knowledge and expertise.

However it is most certainly not an opportunity to "really speak your mind"! Hopefully you wouldn't be sitting there if you felt negatively towards the company: express your admiration for the business and ensure that any "criticism" is framed in the context of an opportunity for you to contribute.

Ultimately when answering the "Why us?" questions** do your research. **When your answers clearly address either 'How do I match the job description?' or 'Why am I a great match for this company?' you can move on to our next blog: How to answer those "Culture fit" and "Teamwork" questions.
