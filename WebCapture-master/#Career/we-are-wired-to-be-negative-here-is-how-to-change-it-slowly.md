Are you feeling negative way too often? You are so not alone. Here is why it happens and what to do about it.

### My own skepticism

I woke up in the middle of the night full of skepticism. I felt like a sponge soaked in the bucket of skepticism, overflowing. My stomach felt tensed and heavy. And I noticed my emotional state. "I am feeling really, really skeptical right now."

A couple of days earlier I started thinking about my next career step, peeling back the layers about my values, strengths, motivation to work and other complex things. I have started focusing on the ideas on how to merge my technical and research skills with my creative and communication skills in something new. I have started brainstorming, daydreaming and opening myself to the new possibilities.

**_And there it was. A good old skepticism. ("Hello, skepticism!") I felt it so clearly as a heaviness, as a cold water, as a darkness. And hundreds of uncontrollable thoughts. "Your ideas are foolish. Do you really think that a career like that exists? Why would YOU get it? Who are you to expect that, anyway? How will you resolve your visa status? Blablabla." I sighed and went back to bed._**

### And I have a hater

In the morning, I received an email about somebody's comment on my old blog post, [Are you a skeptic or are you creator?](https://medium.com/self-starter/are-you-a-skeptic-or-are-you-a-creator-f0afca8d443d) What a coincidence! Skepticism was apparently haunting someone else, too.

**The comment was hateful.** The girl basically wrote that the post is a total bullshit and that I have no idea what I am talking about. She told me that skeptical people can create, too, and asked if I ever heard of four personality types because melancholics are the most creative of all. (I think her ID was Melancholic Something.) She said that I have probably never created anything in my life and hence this entire skeptic-creator thing was a pile of poop.

That pushed my button. My rage rose in 3 seconds and I was ready to jump. "Don't respond to haters!" one voice in my head shouted. "No, you need to tell her!" another one opposed. A nice, juicy draft emerged in my mind:

**_"Dear Miss Melancholic Whatever, thank you for your thoughtful comment and f*ck you. In a skeptic-creator battle, you just proved to be a skeptic and a hater. I can feel the frustrations radiating through your words and I am sorry that it is so. If you are wondering what I have created my writing archives are HERE, HERE and HERE. What's more, I have been writing 10 ideas every day for more than 2 years. You'd better channel your creative energy into something better than hateful comments on other people's work because that's not what happy, creative people do."_**

Phew!

Of course, I did not write that. I let myself slow down (Thank you, [meditation](https://medium.com/@milenarangelov/these-10-ideas-helped-me-establish-meditation-practice-e26f6326a4a3)!) and process what just happened.

**And then I realized something big. Miss Melancholic referred to skeptical people versus creative people. Yet, the key question in my post (bolded and written in all caps) was: Am I a skeptic or am I creator RIGHT NOW? Right now. I called all the people to shift their mindsets from a skeptical one to a creative one in a present moment. The very next sentence was: "You cannot be both at the same time." Yet, Miss Melancholic understood that you can either be one or another and being one excludes the possibility of ever being the other. And I don't blame her. We are all reading half-assed. (If you agree, see the post below.)But there's something else.**

#### We spend so much time soaked in sadness and skepticism that we start believing that we are sad and skeptical people and that there is no way out. We judge ourselves for feeling one way or the other. We create our own vision of ourselves based on our thoughts and emotions.

Yet, all the emotional states are transient, if we let them be so. If we allow emotions vent and burn through us, they will dissolve. We can always acknowledge and honor our emotional states and then choose to see things differently. We can always change. (And [when we change, everything changes.](https://medium.com/prosper-suite/when-you-change-everything-changes-91d0612dea30))

### **We are wired to be negative**

Negativity and skepticism are natural responses to new and uncomfortable situations. (And every day is pretty much new and uncomfortable.)

#### Of course we are negative, we are the descendant of the most skeptical and careful people on the planet, who did not take crazy risks, who did not jump into the fire and who did not push their fingers into the electrical outlets to check what's gonna happen. That's why we are here, and that's why every single one of our risky actions (ranging from writing a new piece of code or blog post, to asking someone out or changing the career or insert your favorite dragon) activates our ancestor's voices of skepticism. That's why some of us wake up in the middle of the night feeling like crap.

Add a nice dose of daily news and social network posts to the equation and you will get a recipe for negativity tsunami. And we do all of it every day.

_(In her research __[Michelle Gielan_](http://michellegielan.com/)_ found out that people who watch 3 minutes of news every morning and 40% more likely to report having a bad day. What's more, the impact of morning news sticks around until evening.)_

Then when your colleague or friend starts bitching and complaining and you start nodding your head, you are already deep in the downward spiral of negativity.

Don't be surprised. Don't give yourself crap for being negative and skeptical. It's our natural inclination, plus our environment adds up a lot to it. But please, don't believe that you are a negative and skeptical person. Negativity and skepticism are emotional states and, once we have awareness, there are many ways to break free from the negative cycle.

> "Gravity works on both physical and emotional levels. Just as I do not wish gravity to pull my muscles, I don't wish spiritual gravity to pull down my thoughts. I work against emotional gravity- thoughts of fear, cynicism, negativity, victim consciousness, anger, judgment, and defensiveness- by praying and meditating throughout the day."

Negativity is a gravity. Very natural. Ever present. Works whether you believe in it or not. Negativity is an inherited, easy, default, risk-averse response. What to do with it?

Just like with gravity, we have to examine it closely, become aware of it, learn how to work with it and use our creativity to find the solutions. Here are some of my favorites.

### 1\. Use the spiritual tools of your choice

In the quote above Marianne Williamson already mentioned prayer and meditation. You can also use journaling, gratitude lists, yoga, affirmations, whatever works and makes you feel better. The most important thing is consistency. Spiritual practices work only when r[epeated and repeated and repeated over time.](https://medium.com/@milenarangelov/we-are-what-we-repeat-the-power-of-process-over-outcome-1010e3f51c37) Every day we will wake up slightly negative and every day we will choose to wash off that negativity with our practice. Slowly, gradually, our brains will rewire.

### 2\. Create environments

[Jim Bunch](http://www.theultimategameoflife.com/author/jimbunch/) created an epic framework about 9 environments that shape our lives ([here's the interview](https://unmistakablecreative.com/designing-your-environment-for-optimal-performance-and-creativity-with-jim-bunch) at [UnmistakableCreative](https://medium.com/@UnmistakableCR)). The idea is that a small fraction of success is contained in our willpower (although we glorify it disproportionately) and much more in how we design our environments. For instance, if you want to lose the weight and you create your environment (i. e. your fridge) so that it supports your goal, you will then have a bunch of fresh food and healthy snacks. When there's no ice cream, you won't have to use your willpower to resist it.

This idea works perfectly in the context of negativity. Take the TV out of your bedroom or hide your remote so that you don't start and end your day with news. Put the book with uplifting content right next to your bed or on your desk so you can pick it up easily. Fill your phone with interesting podcasts and audiobooks that will help you learn and grow. Tidy up; [mess makes us feel anxious.](https://medium.com/strangelove-letters/10-neat-thoughts-about-the-mess-7294344071d1) Be deliberate about your surrounding and you'll see big effects quickly.

### 3\. Surrender your thoughts

Any meditation teacher will tell you: your thoughts just want to pop up and pass. Yet, we are blocking them. We are stopping our thoughts, keeping them in focus for just a little bit longer, we are clinging to them, obsessing about them, going back to them. And, the worst of all, after a while we start believing in our crazy, negative thoughts.

But there is the way out of this loop: surrender your thoughts. Practice letting your thoughts go on a regular basis. Meditation will help a lot. I recently started another interesting practice. I keep a tiny notebook in my drawer and whenever I notice a crazy thought that keeps bothering me, I take the notebook and write it down. Then I add something like: "This is what I've been thinking. I know it doesn't serve me. I am willing to surrender this thought." And it works. It helps me let the thought go in no time. (Plus, all thoughts are much scarier in your head than on the paper.)

Emotional gravity is all around us and it's no wonder that we are negative and skeptical. However, going down with the emotional gravity is an easy way. Rising up and working against it is more tricky and much more rewarding. Use spiritual tools and your environment to uplift yourself ever day. We are all in this together.
