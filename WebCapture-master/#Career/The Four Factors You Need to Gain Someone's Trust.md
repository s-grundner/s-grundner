Whether you're selling a product, giving a speech, or just trying to make new friends, it can be hard to gain someone's trust when you're an utter stranger to them. Fast Company explains that, ultimately, it's about finding a balance between being human and being credible.

Citing Wharton School of Business professor Maurice Schweitzer, Fast Company's Lisa Evans points out that earning someone's trust comes down to four basic factors, and psychologists have been using these as a formula to gain patients' trust for years. When you're aware of these factors, you can take advantage of them when you're trying to make a trustworthy first impression.

  * **[Establishing credibility](http://lifehacker.com/increase-your-credibility-by-avoiding-use-of-the-phrase-1712371931)**: The right jargon or even the way you dress can subtly influence your credibility. 
  
  * **Demonstrating warmth**: You want to make the other person feel at ease. 
  * **Reducing status difference**: Evans says, "To establish trust among employees, Schweitzer recommends managers remove things from their office that reinforce the fact that they have power over the other person. This may be as simple as removing their suit jacket or tieâ€¦"
  * **Be vulnerable**: Allowing yourself to be a little clumsy or tell a corny joke humanizes you and evokes empathy in the other person.

When combined, these four characteristics can go a long way toward establishing trust. Evil week is over, so we're going to assume you'd use these powers for good rather than to manipulate. And really, there are plenty of non-evil instances in which you might need to gain someone's trust: a job interview, for example.
