A difficult conversation has to be a two-way street. You're unlikely to come to a resolution if you don't hear the other person out. But equally important when addressing a conflict is getting your message across. So after you've thoroughly listened to your counterpart, increase the likelihood that they will see things your way by doing the following.

**Own your perspective**  
If you feel mistreated, you may be tempted to launch into your account of the events: "I want to talk about how horribly you treated me in that meeting." But that's unlikely to go over well.

Instead, treat your opinion like what it is: your opinion. Start sentences with "I," not "you." Say "I'm annoyed that this project is six months behind schedule," rather than "You've missed every deadline we've set." This will help the other person see your perspective and understand that you're not trying to blame him.

Explain exactly what is bothering you and follow up by identifying what you hope will happen. You might say, "I appreciate your ideas, but I'm finding it hard to hear them because throughout this process, I've felt as if you didn't respect my ideas. That's my perception. I'm not saying that it's your intention. I'd like to clear the air so that we can continue to work together to make the project a success."

Dorie Clark, author of _[Reinventing You_](http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-You-Define-Imagine-Future/dp/1422144135), says that you should admit blame when appropriate. "It's easy to demonize your colleague. But you're almost certainly contributing to the dynamic in some way, as well," Clark says. Admitting your faults will help set a tone of accountability for both of you, and your counterpart is more likely to own up to her missteps as well. If she doesn't, and instead seizes on your confession and harps on it--"That's exactly why we're in this mess"--let it go.

**Pay attention to your words**  
Sometimes, regardless of your good intentions, what you say can make the issue worse. Other times you might say the exact thing that helps the person go from boiling mad to cool as a cucumber. Here are some phrases that can help make sure you're heard:

  * "Here's what I'm thinking."
  * "My perspective is based on the following assumptions . . ."
  * "I came to this conclusion because . . ."
  * "I'd love to hear your reaction to what I just said."
  * "Do you see any flaws in my reasoning?
  * "Do you see the situation differently?"

There are some basic rules you can follow to keep from pushing your counterpart's buttons. Of course you should avoid name-calling and finger-pointing.

Your language should be "simple, clear, direct, and neutral," says Holly Weeks, author of _[Failure to Communicate_](http://www.amazon.com/Failure-Communicate-Conversations-Wrong-Right/dp/142213749X). Don't apologize for your feelings, either. The worst thing you can do "is to ask your counterpart to have sympathy for you," she says. Don't say things like "I feel so bad about saying this" or "This is really hard for me to do," because it takes the focus away from the problem and toward your own neediness. While this can be hard, this language can make your counterpart feel obligated to focus on making you feel better before moving on.

Liane Davey, author of _[You First: Inspire Your Team to Grow Up, Get Along, and Get Stuff Done_](http://www.amazon.com/You-First-Inspire-Along-Stuff/dp/1118636708), provides two additional rules when it comes to what you say:

  * _Say "and," not "but."_ "When you need to disagree with someone, express your contrary opinion as 'and.' It's not necessary for someone else to be wrong for you to be right," she says. When you're surprised to hear something your counterpart has said, don't interject with a "But that's not right!" Just add your perspective. Davey suggests something like this: "You think we need to leave room in the budget for a customer event, and I'm concerned that we need that money for employee training. What are our options?" This will engage your colleague in problem solving, which is inherently collaborative instead of combative.
  * _Use hypotheticals_. Being contradicted doesn't feel very good, so don't try to counter each of your counterpart's arguments. Instead, says Davey, use hypothetical situations to get him imagining. "Imagining is the opposite of defending, so it gets the brain out of a rut," she says. She offers this example: "I hear your concern about getting the right salespeople to pull off this campaign. If we could get the right people . . . what could the campaign look like?"

**Watch your body language**  
A lot of people unconsciously convey nonverbal messages. Are you slumping your shoulders? Rolling your eyes? Fidgeting with your pen? During your conversation, pay attention to your facial expression, arms, legs, and entire body, and take stock of the overall impression you're giving.

Do the same for your counterpart. If her nonverbal cues are sending a different message than what she's articulating, ask about it. For example, you might say, "I hear you saying that you're fine with this approach, but it looks as if maybe you still have some concerns. Is that right? Should we talk those through?"

**Change the tenor of the conversation**  
Sometimes, despite your best intentions and all of the time you put into preparing for the conversation, things veer off course. You can't demand that your counterpart hold the discussion exactly the way you want.

If things get heated, don't panic. Take a deep breath, mentally pop out of the conversation as if you're a fly on the wall, and objectively look at what's happening. You might even describe to yourself (in your head) what's happening: "He keeps returning to the fact that I yelled at his team yesterday." "When I try to move the conversation away from what's gone wrong to what we can do going forward, he keeps shifting it back." Then state what you're observing in a calm tone. "It looks as if whenever the sales numbers come up, you raise your voice." Suggest a different approach: "If we put our heads together, we could probably come up with a way to move past this. Do you have any ideas?"

If it seems as if you've entered into a power struggle in which you're no longer discussing the substance of your conflict but battling over who is right, step back and either try one of the phrases or questions from the "Pay Attention to Your Words" section above or talk about what's not working. Say, "We seem to be getting locked into our positions. Could we return to our goals and see if we can brainstorm together some new ideas that might meet both our objectives?" Here are some other phrases that help to productively move the conversation along:

  * "You may be right, but I'd like to understand more."
  * "I have a completely different perspective, but clearly you think this is unfair, so how can we fix this?"
  * "I'm not sure how this connects to what we've been talking about. Can you help me make the connection?"
  * "I'd like to give my reaction to what you've said so far and see what you think."
  * "This may be more my perception than yours, but when you said 'X,' I felt . . ."
  * "Is there anything I can say or do that might convince you to consider other options here?"

You can't force your counterpart to appreciate, understand, or even just hear your perspective. But using the tactics above increases the chances. Getting your point across, coupled with hearing your colleague out, is a necessity if you want to reach a resolution.
