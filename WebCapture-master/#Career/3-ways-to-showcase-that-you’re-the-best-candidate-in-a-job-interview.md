Your job in a job interview is to convince the hiring manager that you're the best person for the role and you can make a positive impact on the company if you’re hired. There are three ways that you can do this, and they happen all throughout the interview. The key is to frame things in a way that will both resonate with the hiring manager and clearly show how you’ll be a good fit for the role. 

**Show that you understand the company.**

Showing that you understand the company helps you in two ways. One, it shows the hiring manager that you’ve done your homework and researched the company ahead of your interview. Two, it goes deeper to show that you’ve done more than just skim the homepage of their website and read the CEO’s bio. 

To showcase your understanding, talk about what attracted you to the company. That could be the culture, company initiatives, work environment, or really anything that makes the company unique. If the company was recently in the news for something positive, try to incorporate that into your answer. Avoid things like vacation policy or bonus opportunities, as these will make you look like you’re only in it for the money. 

**Show that you understand the role.**

When you’re able to show the hiring manager that you have a clear understanding of the job you’re interviewing for, it helps them picture you in that role. This answer can be incorporated when you’re asked why you’re the best person for the job or what attracted you to the role. When answering, you’ll want to incorporate three points – an understanding of the job itself, your responsibilities, and how this role has a larger impact within the company. 

Show that you have a solid understanding of the job itself by mentioning what attracted you to the role and why. Then go deeper by talking about the responsibilities and how those play into your strengths. Finally, show that you understand the role is part of a bigger picture by discussing how you’d work with other team members or collaborate with other departments to ensure that your actions lead to overall company success. 

**Showcase your value.**

You should be showcasing your value every time you answer a question. Showcasing your value is what truly sets you apart from other candidates. Not only does this give the hiring manager a clear picture of your strengths, it also highlights your self-awareness, which is a desirable quality in any role. It also helps the hiring manager get an idea of how you work and what they can expect if they hire you. 

The best way to showcase your value is to be detailed in all of your answers. Don’t simply explain ‘why’, go further and provide the ‘how’ or ‘what’ as well. If you’re asked why the company should hire you, clearly state why then back it up with specific reasons. Think of things in terms of how you can add value to the company and use that to fill in the details. If you’re stuck on a value-add idea, think of how you can use your skills to make the biggest impact. 

By doing these three things, you’re giving yourself an advantage in the job interview process and putting yourself one step closer to getting the call that says, ‘you’re hired!’
