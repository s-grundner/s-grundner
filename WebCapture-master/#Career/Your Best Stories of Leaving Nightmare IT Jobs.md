We asked Gizmodo readers about [exiting an awful IT job](http://gizmodo.com/tell-us-your-nightmare-stories-of-how-you-quit-your-ter-1741998889). Whether you quit in a blaze of glory or were laid off in ridiculous circumstances, these are your getting-the-hell-out stories.

> Monthly fire drill came around, we all exited the building to our allocated assembly areas as usual, and then the HR department came around and took our badges and told us we were no longer employed, and that our colleagues would collect our belongings and bring them out to the parking lot. This was in England, where there are supposed to be laws to prevent that sort of bullshit, but just like anywhere, when you're a large enough company, you can find ways to circumvent any law and screw your employees.

> I was in college working part-time for a law firm and supporting AS100 transfers and doing windows 95 support (yes I'm old). One of said As100 transfers didn't work right but I thought it had so thought nothing of it until later in the day the head lawyer called me into his office and berated me, calling me an idiot and a liar in front of several other lawyers and while on the phone with the bank's IT dept who were basically like "It's not a big deal, we can do that transfer over again". Thankfully one of the other lawyers actually stood up for me which was cool, but I knew my days were going to be numbered and I vowed never to be in that situation again. This law firm also fired my fiance' about 2 weeks prior to that incident and my trust with them was shattered after about 3 years of working there.
> 
> That incident is what prompted me to apply for jobs and luckily I got a job (CompuServe) but I was getting married and going on a honeymoon literally 2 weeks before CompuServe wanted me to start so I didn't feel like I could put in a notice and still trust them to honor my vacation pay for the honeymoon. I felt kind of bad about it but on the day that I decided to quit, it just so happened that their billing system went down (you know how lawyers are about billing) and the head lawyer came in frantic saying like "thank God you're back from your honeymoon, we need your help" blah blah blah and praising me up and down. 
> 
> I literally ignored him, went directly to my supervisors office and handed him my resignation letter and walked out the door and never looked back! There were several phone calls that day from other lawyers in the firm but I never called them back. The firm went out of business within a year after that and it couldn't have happened to a better bunch of assholes honestly. Ugh, if only CompuServe had lasted a bit longer for me... But it all worked out in the long run. I have a hell of a career now and can't complain.

I'd decided I was done being told Thursday when I was working the next week and rarely had the same shift 2 days in a row. It took a couple hours to work myself up to it but that was the day I told a customer I'd credit them a quarter so they could call someone who cares, hung up and walked out the door.

On the last day when we were closing up shop and basically just bouncing anyone who called over to a VZ callcenter. I walked in the door, dropped couple hits of acid and had the most fun I'd ever had at work.

> I'll begin with the end. About three months before I left, my mentor there (and one of the real reasons I stayed, I was learning real shit from him) announced his departure and suggested I GTFO too. I didn't immediately: his leaving meant I was the most senior IT guy (aside from the manager) at the company and that meant some interesting times. Having been the mentee of the old man, though, meant I was the go to guy for everything. Literally, in fact, all but one of IT's functions was my responsibility: the servers, Exchange, AD, the network, the firewalls, down to and including the office's keycard system. The one function I didn't get was the backup system. The manager didn't want to be *completely* fucked if I left.
> 
> So they backfilled another Sr. Admin and stuck him in my office with me. He was dense as fuck: instructions down to a basic level ("Call X at the datacenter." "Ok so I'm emailing Y?" "... No, call X. He's on duty. His number's on the list taped to your monitor." "I don't see Y's number here." "NO, man, X." "I don't think X is in today?" "Ok know what, I got it.") were difficult for him. He also spent a lot of time on the phone with his wife, calling her "Baby" in the creepiest way I can imagine. And on top of that, he openly took calls from recruiters and talked salary, with me right there. I told the boss of the difficulties here, he encouraged me to stick with it.
> 
> After three weeks I reached out to some former-coworker contacts who got me a job in short order with another company (that has its own fucked up issues). I gave notice, spent two weeks diligently documenting the SHIT out of every last function I performed on a daily basis and uploading them to the admin team's Sharepoint server used as a knowledgebase. I transitioned this off to a couple of other people, including the guy who was in charge of the backup system.
> 
> We skip ahead a few months. The new job is going very well, everything is far more reasonable, and the pay is finally a little more realistic. In this time, although I'd stuck with the prior company's IM system, I hadn't heard a peep. Until one day, backup guy pings me. He asks for the passwords to the network gear. I told them it was in my documentation. He asked again. I said I didn't remember (I can, 8 years later, still recite them all). He said the Sharepoint server died and all the data was gone.
> 
> And that the backups hadn't been happening.

> 
> I told him sorry, I couldn't remember.
> 
> About a year after that, the company got acquired by another one in town that was known for buying companies and gutting them for customers. One of the coworkers who had stuck around through the whole process and got hired by the new company reached out to me to explain that basically the company was unable to function, at all, after I'd left. Servers went out left and right, customers left in droves, they couldn't hire a competent new admin for anything.
> 
> On the one hand, I feel slightly bad about that. On the other hand, hell of an ego-stroke, right?

Most of what I did could be home based but I was told nope, won't work. Kind of bummed but put in my notice.

I had just spend the morning unloading three days of Burger King into the toilet. It went down but it was a shaky compromise and I knew the next to use it was rolling the dice. It was the boss, as expected. He went into the stall, did his business and the complex shook as the toilet exacted its foul vengeance. He screamed about his loafers as the water came pouring out under the door. It was a good last day.

I was more or less the production engineer, but as we wear many hats, I was unofficially put in charge of the server equipment, as well as software, computer repairs, bug removal, training, and I also had to deal with the delicate issue of people's personal use on the internet (Not that I would know _anything _about that).

> Our business manager handled all expenses; she was the kind of person who made herself important and "solved" all problems by simply squawking the same line over and over like a parrot "Stop spending money! Stop spending money!" If a small Dell server costs $5,000, she couldn't wrap her head around it, because her e-machine at home only cost $400. This carried through to my Engineering job when I had to purchase machine parts for production and I'd have to battle over spending a few hundred bucks to repair a half-million dollar piece of equipment

This machine was absolutely necessary to certify products so we could ship to our customers. I told them "Give me the card, I'm going out and getting what we need." Fed up, I got a basic $600 desktop that would handle the hardware, I also got a few other things on my list, a new HDD for our now FULL Dell dimension server, some needed cables for our switch, and some other very basic stuff, I can't remember. I spent hours getting the desktop installed and tested, right back into production by the next morning.

Despite a full expense report and justifications on each line, they couldn't figure out how I spent the better part of (gasp) A Thousand Dollars, on server/client equipment. At this point, I should mention that our revenue was around $2M and the managers typically would go out and spend $400 on lunch. Now, granted, I did go over my manager's head, I was still authorized to make any necessary purchases.

> Well, after my "big spending" adventure, the atmosphere in the company changed. I was soon excluded from any important design meetings and I knew my time had come to an end. I called it right to the hour they would come in and let me go. I later find out that the equipment I purchased was all installed by our other (outside) IT guy. They even had me on edge for 2 weeks because the big book of software went missing right after I left. Turns out one of the managers took it home for personal use and then brought it back.

Those kids will grow up thinking that being racist, homophobic, over weight, obnoxiously boisterous to make up for the fact that, in regular conversation, you don't have anything interesting to offer, so you choose to be loud and overbearing, will be the way you're supposed to be as a white republican living in the good old United States of America.

It takes about an hour to see that the porn on the network was being synced FROM the terminals...

> We call the lead, who immediately asks if we used Clone - Dell 5/5 - NBI (Newest Base Image). We say no, we used this other random one that was stored separately, like one would think a master copy would be. Nope, we cloned 80 computers with a drive **Held For Investigation** by a guy who used a VPN to DL super-sketchy porn (think incest, vomit, scat, sleep, and underage candids) all day long instead of working.

I look over, and my co-worker is filling his messenger bag with office supplies, tools, and parts. He smiles and says, "Quit or Fired? You have about 30 minutes to decide." He shakes my hand, grunts his bag up on his shoulder, and just walks out. I see him go to the parking lot, get in his car, and drive away.

No girly posters, no frat-bros, mostly female staff. Cognitive dissonance doesn't even scratch the surface.

People on both teams in the too-small room (we had been moved to another, smaller, office a week after I started) were downright RUDE. I mentioned one of my hobbies to the boss, and then he would consistently ask everyone else in the office if they were interested in joining me (I sing in a men's acapella chorus) despite my repeated requests to stop.

> New Director of IT started - put me on as a programming resource to a guy who'd literally suffered brain damage after a fall during Hurricane Wilma. He'd been working on a "deviated cost" project for 3 years and not gotten it out the door. He shot me over a spec - some data massaging - and I got the routine done, I worked remotely that week. The spec was flawed so the end result was, also. We went into the weekly Senior Staff meeting wherein the new Dir told all dozen or so there (that Id known for years) that there was no progress on the project because Id "been out sick" \- right as the meeting ended. I told him to wait for a moment and close the door. He looked me in the eye and said, "You don't understand office politics, you can't always tell the truth." I got up, walked into the President's office and stated that the Dir had lied, the spec was flawed and tendered my 2-weeks notice.

One day, he screwed up his computer and called for an IT guy. The guy showed up and Mort told him he had three minutes to fix the problem or he was fired. I was sitting there with my mouth gaping open like a moron because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Mort hovered over the IT guy, looking at his watch, berating the poor dude the whole time. Oh, while blowing cigar smoke all over the place. Of course, three minutes later, he yells at the guy to get the fuck out because he's fired. I felt so awful, the guy looked like he was going to cry (and he had only started recently).

Soon after I started I realized that my manager knew nothing about IT but swore new shiny objects and operating systems were the only way. If I dared question the decision to upgrade the whole company to the newest OS on the day of a realease I would get a stern talking to in a meeting. This lead to multiple "check-ins" a day and questioning my every move. Literally, I had my email swept through one day because it looked too "messy" and that my grammar wasn't always up to standards (even though I have a Bachelor's in English).

I asked countless times when I would have my own team, with the answer always being "we are looking into it."Eventually I was told they were going to just hire another counterpart and keep my salary where it was. The final straw was when I was given notice that a huge project was due on the exact weekend I told my manager months ahead I would be out bc my family and gf were planning something for my birthday. I put out my resume and got hired at a large firm within a week. Put in my two weeks, spent two weeks teaching a temp everything I built for the company and then got the hell out right before the big project weekend. They called me that weekend for help and I told them I could give remote advice after my party for a very large consulting fee, which they turned down. I still have nightmares from that place and possibly some PTSD ( not really) but thankfully love my new company.

I see where this is going. So boss hires the new admin (who is older and has no tech background at all) and tells me to teach her stuff like how to write macros and recover files from a failed hard drive. All while simultaneously telling me how much I'm messing everything up and that maybe this wasn't working out.

I value my sanity more than your money. I actually blocked the office number and boss lady's cell phone, and then the new admin started calling me from HER cell about two days later. I hadn't heard from them in a while and moved on with my life... until three days ago when I got a text from the NEW new admin begging me for help. Sweet Jesus. I'm going to have to change my number.

Seriously; a UK wide and some EU customer base of people dealing with emergency medical care, and the sick and dying simply cannot have a First Line team of FOUR people! Including barely trained me, and lunchtime periods staggered over three hours meant even less during those hours, and that's not even accounting for when people called in sick...

Being sub-contractors with no IT department to speak of, their mandate was that large printed labels be created by hand as excel spreadsheets, printed out and laminated, and fixed with zipties to the bins. Repeat the entire process again for each and every part.
> 
> Realizing the scope of the task ahead of me, I spent nights and weekends developing an excel macro that would take a list of parts from a spreadsheet, import and resize a corresponding image, and print out the labels to be laminated. I went from making 5 labels an hour to 50, management was amazed, and suddenly I was asked to meet with the development team at the factory across the street.
> 
> My hacked together solution was so impressive to them that they asked if I would be interested in someday traveling to their plants across the country (and potentially world) to duplicate the label making process elsewhere. Job descriptions were drafted, an offer extended - as a college student I was star-struck. Until I found out that they were expecting me to perform this service at the same rate that they were paying their janitor ($14/hr).
> 
> I left my excel macro and instruction pamphlet with them when I gave my two weeks notice. I got a phone call a month later that the macro had broken and they were hoping I could fix it for free. I declined, and the whole operation fell apart shortly thereafter. Last time I checked, the warehouse was closed and the factory had moved overseas.

I completed all the required things to go for the next level designation. But the the Account manager removed my name from the promotions list to balance his account budget to show to his reporting manager his performances are good, I just gave my resignation.

I was sitting on my desk at my cubicle, listening to my supervisor as the customer blew sunshine up my ass, when the call floor manager walked around. She told me to go home and change my shoes, because they weren't allowed by the dress code. I was wearing pair of Chuck Taylor All-Stars with my khaki's and polo-esque shirt.

> "Well go home and change them anyway...because I said so." She told me, and I responded, "I'm getting a compliment call...a client was so impressed with my service that they wanted to tell my boss what a good job I'm doing, and you are sending me home because you don't like my shoes?!?!"
> 
> "Yes."
> 
> My super handed me my headset back, and told the customer exactly what had happened while they were talking to my super, and that if she sent me home I was not going to come back. My super, and his boss, the call floor manager were both looking at me with their jaws open wide as I told the client, and them as much.

> I worked for a network owned television station as a Master Control Operator. It was a fancy title for the television version of a radio station's DJ. When I started it was video tapes in machines, and we upgraded to a networked digital file server. My IT experience made me one of the logical choices for helping to install the thing.

> After it was up and running, they decided to lay everyone with my job title off, and remotely control the TV station in Birmingham from Miami.

> They were pretty good about it, and gave us a healthy severance package.

> I worked as a software developer for a food service company. It was a family owned business and had terrible management. I really liked my manager, but he had enough and finally quit. After seeing people getting fired day after day and watching all the new business ventures continue to underperform, I was ready to leave. Having just had a child and dealing with the life changes that brings, I tried to keep some stability and stuck it out for a while. I mentioned OSHA violations and got aggressively responded to.

> The last straw was when the CIO decided to put me on a performance improvement plan. He wrote me up for the exact things he and his friends were doing and decided to assign to me a few personal growth projects. One was to read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. That book was essentially a chronicle of the CIO's failures as a person. The hypocrisy was comical. I decided to take one of the standing offers I had from my job search and put in my notice the same day they wanted me to sign the PIP. It was April Fools day. Best career move I ever made.

I had 2 young children and after 18 months of salary work, 50 hours a week witb no raise, my patience with the place was thin. The one partner was a religious fanatic and conspiracy theorist. He would go on about contrails from planes, and government conspiracies. It was painful to listen to and was a stressful workplace for me, but I had a wife and kids to support. On top of everything during this time, we had a house fire and had lost just about everything and were displaced while our house was being gutted and remodeled.

At this point, still sick, no raise and dealing with this shitbag company, I had enough.

He gave me a perplexed look as I immediately walked across the hall to the other partner's office looked him the eye and told him "Fuck you. Fuck this bullshit job, fuck your bullshit conspiracy theories. I quit, good luck trying to find someone else to put up with your ridiculous fucked up bullshit."

The last I heard they were still in business (I don't know how) and that the one cool partner had been bought out and no longer was associated. Fred, if you read this, I would love to hear from you.
