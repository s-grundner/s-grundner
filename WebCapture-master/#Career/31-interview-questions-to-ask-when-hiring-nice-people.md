[Hiring people](http://blog.redbranchmedia.com/2015/10/27/hiring-from-the-ground-up/) with the right technical skills? That's becoming routine, if never easy. But hiring people who are going to do right by my clients and employees? That's even tougher. There's no "right" way to predict whether or not you're going to hire a client dud or rockstar, but there are queries you can ask during [the interview process](http://blog.redbranchmedia.com/2016/04/04/5-ways-to-handle-your-shaky-nerves-during-an-interview/) that will help you understand whether or not the candidate sitting in front of you will get the job done.

A great question will force the candidate to think, get them out of their comfort zone and can reveal things that aren't on their resume. While this list might seem long, you can offer it up to multiple members of your hiring team, or just ask various people to ask 1-2 questions.

Afraid to conduct multiple interviews? Here are some helpful tips:

**Ask open-ended questions**. Instead of asking something that can be easily answered with a yes or a no, try something that elicits a story from the candidate. Encourage applicants to tell you about specific real examples of something that illustrates that story.

**Ask follow up questions.** Not just to get the real scoop but to practice active listening. It's hard to ask good follow ups if you've spent the last 20 minutes wondering if you left the garage door open.

**Revisit certain areas**. Ever kick yourself after an interview? That's usually because you [just came up with the answer to a question](http://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-answer-the-31-most-common-interview-questions)! Save your applicant this drama and the sore shins and ask something similar throughout the interview. Give them a second shot at that perfect job-winning answer.

**Silence of the interviewers.** Chatterboxing your way through an interview is a surefire way to miss clues and talk over someone who's likely already nervous, so quit it. Also, when candidates have to talk to fill silence it gives you a chance to learn more than you otherwise might have if you'd have jumped right in.
