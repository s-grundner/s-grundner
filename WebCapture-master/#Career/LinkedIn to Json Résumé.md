This is a small website that exports your LinkedIn profile to a [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/).

The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/JMPerez/linkedin-to-json-resume).

Due to [recent restrictions](https://github.com/JMPerez/linkedin-to-json-resume/issues/10) added to the LinkedIn API, this web app can't ask for access to user's full profile. Thus, the best way is to export your data from LinkedIn and import it in this tool.

## Instructions

  1. Go to the [Data Export Page](https://www.linkedin.com/settings/data-export-page) on LinkedIn and click on "Request archive".
  2. You will get an email from LinkedIn confirming your request. You will need to wait up to 72 hours to get a link to download your data.
  3. After some hours you will receive a link to download your archive. Click on it and save the zip file.
  4. Drag and drop or select the file (its name should be something like LinkedInDataExport_XX-XX-XXXX.zip) in the area below:
