# Painless Resumes With Markdown

_Captured: 2015-12-25 at 23:48 from [www.davidhampgonsalves.com](http://www.davidhampgonsalves.com/Markdown-resume)_

Latex might be the most fashionable format for the discerning developer but I think its overkill. For my current resume rerwrite I choose markdown because:

  * Its plan text so its easy to **edit** and **version**.
  * Its super simple and you are probably already well versed.
  * There are already a bunch of nice css templates to work from.
  * You can use it to generate most formats you may need.

This is my [resume](http://www.davidhampgonsalves.com/html/resume.html). Which is generated from this [markdown](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/resume), using [markdown-resume.js](https://github.com/c0bra/markdown-resume-js).
