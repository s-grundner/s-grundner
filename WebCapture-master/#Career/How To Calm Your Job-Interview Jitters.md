# How To Calm Your Job-Interview Jitters

Almost everyone has jitters or gets nervous before a job interview. The feeling is very much like stage fright. That's no surprise, since so many job interviews are like auditions!

It is crazy the way we interview people. I never knew the "correct" way to interview when I became an HR person back in 1984.

I interviewed people the obvious way -- the human way.

I started out by asking them "Did you find our building easily? Do I need to change the way I give directions?"

Of course, there was no Google Maps back then!

Then I asked "What do you want to know about the job or the company as we get started? You probably have questions for me!"

People do have questions when they come to a job interview. As an interviewer it's polite to let the job candidate ask his or her questions first.

How can anyone attend to the conversation if they have burning questions that they're waiting to ask?

Also, a job-seeker's questions will tell you a lot more about them than their answers to lame, scripted job-interview questions will.

Still, not everyone has learned how to interview job candidates in a human way! You're going to have to be ready for whatever interviewing style a particular employer or a particular interviewer uses.

Here are three techniques for keeping calm before and during a job interview:

  1. Be more than ready.
  2. Get out of your head by getting physical.
  3. Have an interview plan.

"Be more than ready" means investing two to three hours before the interview preparing for it.

I'm not telling you to prepare for the interview so that you can impress the interviewer, although I predict that you will do that.

The principal reason to invest all that research time is so that you feel incredibly well-prepared and comfortable walking into the interview.

That will reduce your nervous feelings tremendously!

You almost can't do too much pre-interview research. You need to know what the company's business is and who its competitors are. You need to read and think about the biographies of the people who lead the organization, including the person who will be your boss if you accept the job.

You need to look into the organization's market situation, whether they're growing or shrinking or staying the same size, and what they've recently announced or launched. You have to read their press releases and read what bloggers and industry pundits say about them.

All this research isn't like preparing for a test in school.

You're not studying the company so you can answer questions about it.

You're conducting your research so that you can ask better questions, generate more insights about their most likely Business Pain points and generally approach the interview the same way a consultant would approach a prospective-client meeting.

Your preparation will pay off. You'll be able to ask more thoughtful questions because of all the ground work you've already done.

Don't wait until the night before your interview to start your research; the whole point of your study sessions is to familiarize yourself with the employer and let its issues and opportunities sift around in your brain, even when you're sleeping.

You've got to compose thoughtful questions to bring with you to the interview. Save your Pain-related questions for your actual hiring manager.

Most HR screeners and internal recruiters won't be able to answer questions about the Business Pain facing your manager, and those folks are more likely to stick to the standard interview script, as well.

Here's an example of the type of research-fueled questions a thoughtful job applicant will prepare to ask his or her hiring manager:

"How do you expect the recent merger of your competitors Gormless Products and Charlatan Industries to affect your company's marketing strategy next year?"

**Get out of your head -- get physical!**

Just before your interview is the time when your nerves may threaten to overwhelm you. That's when your heart can start to race, your breathing can get shallow and you may feel faint or nauseated.

All of this is normal, but only in the sense that these are normal reactions to a very stilted and ridiculously formal process.

Here's the remedy for debilitating nerves just before an interview: get physical!

You have to overwhelm your busy, anxious mind by getting your body revved up and actually exhausting yourself. We tell our clients to run up and down three flights of stairs.

If you're already physically active, you have to do even more than that.

You can park your car a few blocks away from the interview facility and do jumping jacks or run short sprints (bring your running shoes!). I'm not talking about a few wimpy stretches.

To clear away the pre-interview butterflies in your stomach, you have to get winded, and then some.

This technique works!

No one will know you're exhausted when you arrive at the interview (just don't be sweaty -- you can bring an extra shirt or blouse and change in the car).

Rather, they'll see you composed and calm. Your heart might be pounding because you just finished an intensive workout. That's good!

**Have an interview plan.**

Most job-seekers don't make an interview plan. They just show up and hope to withstand whatever gets thrown at them. That's one reason job-seekers feel so nervous before a job interview.

Almost anything could happen! You don't know these people. They might be awesome and friendly. They might be toads. You won't know until you get there and meet them.

An interview plan is simple. You'll start by disarming an interviewer who might jump right to the script. You'll make an attempt to keep that from happening by shifting the frame the minute you and your interviewer shake hands. Here's how it works:

INTERVIEWER (Spotting you on the visitor's couch, walking over and extending her hand to shake): Hi, Ashley! I'm Gloria Jones. We spoke on the phone.

YOU (Standing and extending your hand to shake): So nice to meet you, Gloria! I noticed on your LinkedIn profile that you play the cello. Do you still play?

GLORIA (turning to walk to another room -- you follow): Oh, goodness! You saw that? I do play. I play with the City Symphony. We play five concerts a year.

YOU (Walking and chatting): How fun! How do you find the combination of HR and classical cello-playing?

There's no guarantee that you can change the energy in the traditional, excessively scripted and fake interview protocol, but you can try!

If it doesn't work, you will quickly adjust and become the Sheepie Job Seeker your interviewer was expecting.

(In that case, though, you must ask yourself "Do I want to work for people who employ HR screeners who can't get off the script?")

This technique works well, too. Just don't mention anything really personal, like a death in the interviewer's family or his or her divorce decree found online.

You'll make a frame-shift attempt the minute you meet your interviewer. Some interviewers are delighted to get off the script.

They only resort to asking their dumb scripted questions because the job-seeker seems to expect it and doesn't move the conversation in any other direction.

Your interview plan continues whether you get your interviewer off the script or not.

If your interviewer is an HR screener or an internal recruiter, you won't probe for [Business Pain](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2015/05/15/what-kind-of-business-pain-do-you-solve/).

They probably won't know much about your manager's Business Pain anyway and they'll want to get back to their script or their own off-the-cuff questions. That's fine!

You'll answer each of their questions with a brief 'Answerette' and then ask your own question back.

That's about as far as you can typically go off the script with anyone other than your hiring manager.

Here's an illustration:

RECRUITER: So Ashley, you've used Excel before, I see. How long have you been using Excel.

ASHLEY: Well, I guess about four years -- I probably used Excel a little bit back in college, but I wouldn't have said I was much of an Excel user then. Certainly since I started my job at the bank I've been using Excel every day. How will the person in this job use Excel?

Your interviewer may not know the answer to your question, sadly. In my opinion no one should be allowed to interview for a job unless that person completely understands the job.

What is the point of a job interview conducted by a screener who doesn't know the job inside and out? Alas, many companies are out to lunch where their interviewing processes are concerned. They are asleep at the wheel.

They let any old anybody interview candidates and even the candidates can tell that the interviewer knows zip-all about how the actual job is performed. That's shameful, but distressingly common.

When you interview with your hiring manager, your interview plan intensifies. Now you are hunting for pain. You will ask Business Pain questions of your manager every chance you get. Now you have a real plan!

You didn't come to sit on a chair like a fourth-grader taking an oral exam, and answer questions put to you. You are an adult, and a wise advisor. You need to hear about somebody's pain, or you have no reason to stick around and answer questions.

Here are some of the Pain-related questions you can ask your hiring manager:

You won't solve the manager's pain right in the interview. There'd be no reason to hire you if you did!

You will lay out your process for solving the pain (should you be hired) instead:

MANAGER: I can see that you really understand this issue. It's probably our biggest headache right now. How would you solve it?

YOU: I'd start by reading everything you've got in writing here about the issue -- reports or email messages or presentations anyone has given on the topic. I'd conduct a lot of interviews. You've got tremendously smart people here and I know some of them have spent a lot of time looking at this issue.

MANAGER: Okay, and then…?

YOU: I'd dig in and look at what you've already tried to surmount the problem, and I'd look at the financial impact of doing nothing versus doing something and the possibilities for what that solution might be. Your situation is unique.

You guys are the experts on your business and you've spent a year dealing with this. It would be irresponsible of me to say "Oh, well, I'd fix your problem this way or that way!" meeting you for the first time today.

Once I'd looked at the options for solving this issue, I'd present you with alternatives and my own recommendation, plus budgets and timelines for all of them, of course.

Do you still feel jittery? I hope not! You will empower yourself by nailing your interview preparation, exhausting yourself physically before the interview and walking in with a plan.

It's your conversation, too -- you have as much to learn about the employer as anybody on their side of the desk has to learn about you.

Remember that only the people who get you, deserve you, and then show up and have a great conversation! If they love you, fine. If they hate you, great! Who cares who they love or hate? You deserve to work among people who appreciate you. Everybody else can jump in a lake.

Don't forget -- after the interview, you owe yourself a nice gelato.

Enjoy your frosty treat and celebrate having conquered your interview nerves. You are a Mojofied Job Seeker now!
