There are plenty of good business reasons why more companies should consider a [remote workforce](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/bill-gates-says-companies-that-offer-this-perk-to-employees-will-have-a-clear-edge.html). Besides it being the future of work, remote jobs could benefit [employees' mental well-being](http://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-work-from-home-improve-your-mental-health-apple-dell-walt-disney-are-now-hiring-for-these-remote-jobs.html), lower their stress, and make them more productive. 

One new study that captured my attention in support of these claims is [FlexJobs's 2019 Annual Survey](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/survey-flexible-work-job-choices/) (their 8th annual "Super Survey" on flexible work). FlexJobs asked more than 7,300 respondents to weigh in on how flexibility at work (or a lack thereof) affects their job choices and their choices to [stay or leave](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/surprising-reason-why-employees-quit.html) their respective companies. 

## Why people leave their companies

In their [published report](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/survey-flexible-work-job-choices/), one statistic that stood out for me answers a lot of questions about why people are quitting their jobs:

> "Thirty percent of respondents reported leaving a job because it did not offer flexible work options."

There's your entire reason in four words: **No flexible work options**. (A very tweetable quote.)

That's nearly one-third of employees choosing to exit because their employers may have failed to adapt to the shifting needs of people desiring more freedom and work-life integration. 

According to the [FlexJobs report](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/survey-flexible-work-job-choices/), there are now four reported reasons people seek flexible work, putting the pressure on decision makers to change work policies to more flexible work arrangements:

  * Work-life balance (75 percent)
  * Family (45 percent)
  * Time savings (42 percent)
  * Commute stress (41 percent)

Other findings that caught my attention include:

  * 16 percent of workers are currently looking for a new job because of flexibility issues.
  * 80 percent also said they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options.
  * 73 percent list work-life balance as one of the "most important factors" they consider when evaluating a job prospect (ranking well above health insurance, vacation time, and other benefits).

## What's the business case for employers? 

Companies of every size are faced with a harsh reality once reserved for "future of work" conversations in the board room. As more [Gen Zers](http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/6-things-to-know-about-gen-z-before-you-ever-start-working-with-them.html) enter the labor market, remote work is predicted to become the norm. In fact, by 2028, 73 percent of all teams will have remote employees, according to UpWork's [2019 Future Workforce Report](https://www.upwork.com/i/future-workforce/fw/2019/).

As distributed workforces grow and employees start spending less time in-office, decision-makers and chief HR people must adapt to create more flexible work. 

According to the [FlexJobs survey report](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/survey-flexible-work-job-choices/), there are five compelling business reasons why they should:

## 1\. Employee retention

Eighty percent of respondents said they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options (up from 75% in 2018).

## 2\. Reducing expenses

Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they would take a 10% or 20% cut in pay; 21% are willing to forfeit vacation time; 16% said they would give up employer-matching retirement contributions.

## 3\. Productivity

Sixty-five of respondents think they would be more productive working from home than working in a traditional office environment due to fewer distractions (74%), fewer interruptions from colleagues (72%), reduced stress from commuting (70%), and minimal office politics (64%).

## 4\. Education and experience

Work flexibility appeals to highly educated and experienced workers. Seventy-eight percent of respondents have at least a college degree; 69% having at least a bachelor's degree and 28% having a graduate degree. And in their professions, 33% are manager level or higher.

## 5\. Hiring strategy

Ninety-seven percent of respondents are interested in being a flexible worker in the long-term. Offering flexible work options can help attract well-educated professionals with solid experience who come from a variety of backgrounds.
