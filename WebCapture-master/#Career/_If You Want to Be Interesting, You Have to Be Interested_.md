No one wants to be considered dull, whether you're [meeting new people](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-be-more-interesting-when-meeting-new-people-1612086910) or trying to impress familiar ones. The quote above from _Steal Like An Artist_ author Austin Kleon reminds us that the key to becoming a more interesting person is to become more interested.

I think the quote works on two levels. When you become more interested in other people--[actively listening](http://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-improve-my-listening-skills-1333981305) to them and engaging with them--they'll see you as more interesting.

Kleon's talking about curiosity in general, though: Developing your curiosity for the world around you, whether through reading, trying new activities, or otherwise constantly broadening your horizons. He notes writer Lawrence Weschler's advice to practice "the continual projection of interest."
