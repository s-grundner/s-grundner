I think we can all agree that the job search is, well, kind of scary. Even if you’re confident that [your current job just isn’t the right fit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauragarnett/2015/01/30/quiz-is-your-job-right-for-you/#150561774df7), the entire process is intimidating. And perhaps one of the most daunting parts is the job interview. Yes, landing an interview—getting your job application noticed _and _having a recruiter contact you (finally!)—is very exciting. But after the initial rush of adrenaline wears off, the anxiety creeps in. Not only will you have to talk about yourself, but you have to do it in a way that convinces the company that you’re the very best fit for the role. And that can be downright terrifying. 

Because as strange as it may seem, most of us aren’t experts on ourselves. If asked one of the most common job interview questions, “What are your greatest strengths?” we freeze. 

This isn’t entirely our fault. When it comes to nailing one of the most critical aspects of a job search, the education system has failed us. Sure, we can put together a decent resume and write a five-paragraph essay (maybe). But knowing ourselves and clearly identifying our true strengths? Good one. 

And because we don’t understand this about ourselves, we typically fail to find a job that’s a good fit. Instead, we try to mold ourselves to whatever the job description says.  And this strategy may get you a job, but it’s probably the wrong one.

So if you’re ready to[ like your job more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauragarnett/2015/03/05/3-ways-to-like-your-job-more-today/#2a78ac6b16bb) and create a career you love, you need to get to know yourself and your strengths better—and learn how to speak about them with confidence. Here’s where you can start. 

**The Secret: Know Your Zone of Genius**

When I was researching the science in search of what made great performance, it was clear. You needed to be challenged, in a good way, and you need to be intrinsically motivated – which means you have natural endless energy for your work. If you’re challenged and intrinsically motivated, it’s nearly impossible not to love work and achieve the kind of long term success that you desire. 

So how do you do that? Your first step is to identify your Zone of Genius, which consists of two data points, your Genius and your Purpose. 

**Genius: **Your Genius is the thinking or problem-solving that you’re best at. It’s often hard to see it because it’s so ingrained into how you think, but if you’re conscious of the moments that you’re in the Zone, that sweet spot where you’re so challenged by the thinking or problem-solving that you’re doing that you lose track of time, then you will notice it.

How do you uncover your Genius? Notice the moments that you’re in this “Zone” and then write down what the thinking or problem-solving is that you’re doing. Do this for a couple of weeks, and you will see patterns. Name that pattern, and you have your Genius. 

**Purpose:** Your purpose is the impact on others or in the world that is most meaningful to you. Your Purpose is connected to a core emotional challenge that you’ve had in your past, developed as a result of a reoccurring series of negative experiences or as a result of one life altering event that shifted you from that point forward. Identify your core emotional challenge and you have the key to unlocking fulfillment in yourself. 

For example, my core emotional challenge was not being seen or understood, therefore it is endlessly meaningful for me to help others see themselves for who they are and apply that to their careers. 

**In the Interview**

When you know your Genius, it becomes easy to talk about your strengths in an interview. Try this: “I’m best at [your Genius]. I’m most motivated and productive when I’m working on [projects that allow you to use your Genius]. For example, here’s a time when that work led to incredible results for my company.”

Knowing your purpose is also game-changing. In the interview process, you can share what impact is most meaningful to you and how you can bring your purpose into the open position. Demonstrating to a potential employer that you are able to have endless energy for a job and that you can manage your own motivation makes you look like a superstar. 

Once you know your genius and your purpose, you have data that allows you to more easily assess a potential opportunity and speak with authority on its fit and the value you bring to the table. What I have discovered is knowing your Zone of Genius makes having a job you don’t love a choice. When you know this about yourself you are no longer a victim of circumstances, you are in the driver seat of your career.
