I just released something on npm! Actually, my resume theme ([Eloquent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-eloquent)) has been available in the npm repository for over a month, but now it just reached 1.0.0.

Here's what it looks like:

I created this [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) theme when I was looking for a new job. My aim was to make sure that I'd be able to deliver a full-lenght version of my resume if needed. I started by [retrieving my LinkedIn data](https://github.com/JMPerez/linkedin-to-json-resume), and used the Elegant theme.

Here are features that are new compared to Elegant:

  * Mobile First theme.
  * Download your resume with a single click, in a single file.
  * Keep your resume offline if you want to: the theme is self-contained.
  * Obfuscates your email address and phone number from spam bots.
  * Gorgeous Open Sans web font.
  * Optimized for print and screen readers.
  * Contains Schema.org markup to make the most of your content.
  * All fields are optional, pick what you need!

IMHO it is much more important for a resume to look great than for a portfolio. The resume may be the first thing any recruiter will look at, and first impression matters. **A lot.** That's why the theme is quite boring to look at -- its most important feature is to make your content stand out.

Here's the result on my own resume: [thib.me/cv](https://thib.me/cv).
