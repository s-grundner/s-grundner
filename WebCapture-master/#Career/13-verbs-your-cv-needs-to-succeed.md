> _Every word you write in your CV is important._

But the [verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb) you use are arguably the most important words in your CV.

Verbs are commonly known as "doing words". They are used to describe actions.

And it is crucial that your CV verbs accurately describe how your personal actions have benefited your employers, so that hiring managers can see the benefits of employing you.

Verbs quite literally tell employers what you have done

So here at StandOut CV, we have surveyed 150 employers across all major industries to find out what the most impressive verbs to include in your CV are.

We have focused the study on generic verbs as opposed to industry specific verbs, so that you can apply these verbs to your CV no matter what profession you are in.

So take a look at our list of the most valued CV verbs and see if you can fit some of them into your own CV.

## **Managed**

![Managed](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/12946396_s_medium.jpg?v=1477330387)

[Management skills](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management.html) are crucial in business, regardless of your profession or seniority. However this is not strictly limited to staff management.

This could also include** time management**, **supplier management**, **process management**, **stakeholder management**… The list could go on forever.

The definition of management is **"the process of controlling things or people"** - so to include the term _managed_ in your CV, shows recruiters that you have control over your responsibilities and are able to drive the results that your employer needs.

So it's no surprise that **92% of employers surveyed** rated_ managed_ as a **very important verb** that they would want to see in a CV.

## **Delivered**

**![Delivered](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/49328454_s_medium.jpg?v=1477330593)**

> _Businesses like employees who deliver._

Whether you deliver sales, cost savings or large projects; it's essential to show recruiters the end product of your work by explaining what you have delivered.

For [example a project manager CV](https://standout-cv.com/pages/project-manager-cv-example) might include:

** "Delivered £1m relocation project ensuring successful set of 300 new employee work stations and IT setup"**

Or a teacher may include:

** "Delivered 20% increase in class attendance average exam results for 95% of students"**

So be sure to include some examples of the results you have delivered in your own CV.

## **Improved**

To improve means **"to make or become better"** so it's obvious why hiring managers love to see this verb in CVs.

If you're an employee who can be brought on board to drive positive change within an organisation, you will be invaluable to an employer.

So whether you have improved processes, compliance records, sales figures or any other quantifiable metric for past employers; it should definitely be mentioned in your CV.

Try to include some tangible figures to show readers the scale of the improvements you have made, for example:

**"Improved ticket logging process resulting in a 30% increase in customer satisfaction" **

## **Reduced**

Reduction is often perceived as a negative term, but there are plenty of positive ways to implement reductions in a business.

Reducing company spending or resource use is hugely beneficial to an employer.

So if you have been involved in any cost or time saving activities, then get them into your CV.

## **Negotiated**

**![Negotiated](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/36610224_s_medium.jpg?v=1475004502)**

People often assume that [negotiation ](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/negotiation.html)is purely a tool for sales staff, but actually it can be applied to many areas of business.

When dealing with suppliers, it's important to negotiate the best prices.

When leading a team, it is important to negotiate a fair work load between team members.

**65% of employers** surveyed said that they would like to see the term negotiated somewhere on a candidate's CV, so try to think of a way you can include it in your own.

## **Planned**

**![Planned](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/41058179_s_medium.jpg?v=1477330848)**

Planning is the backbone of success, so it's vital to show employers that you are capable of methodical and effective planning.

Your CV should contain solid examples of how you have created work plans and directed them through to completion in order to achieve your employers' goals.

## **Supported**

Showing that you can support others is another way of proving that you can be relied upon.

Whether you support your clients, line manager or team members - ensure that your CV shows how your actions benefit those who you interact with.

Most businesses exist to solve problems and help others, so being capable of support is hugely valuable.

## **Influenced**

The ability to influence others is a necessary talent for getting things done in any industry.

From influencing potential customers to believe in a new product, to influencing senior staff to provide resources for a key project - the power of influence is always in high demand.

If you have been able to use your influence to the benefit of previous employers, then detail it in your CV.

## **Trained**

**![Trained](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/40279774_s_medium.jpg?v=1477331140)**

> _The ability to train others is appreciated by employers for two reasons_

Firstly it shows that you have plenty of expertise in your field along with the gravitas and communication skills to deliver training sessions.

Secondly, staff are a business's most valuable asset, so anybody who can be relied upon to further strengthen a team will always be of benefit.

## **Resolved**

Businesses face problems every day that need to be resolved

So it stands to reason that if you can prove your ability to resolve issues, you will [impress recruiters with your CV.](https://standout-cv.com/blogs/life-and-work-careers/116629508-how-recruiters-read-your-cv)

So whether you are resolving client complaints or internal work process problems, use your CV to explain how you can identify and resolve issues to ensure the smooth running of your employers' business.

## **Presented**

![Presented](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/4797/files/37149820_s_medium.jpg?v=1477331472)

[Public speaking](http://www.inc.com/ss/jeff-haden/20-public-speaking-tips-best-ted-talks) of any kind can be a daunting task but it's a hugely valuable skill for any employee to have.

From presenting findings of research to an internal stakeholder, to presenting a new product to a crowd of potential customers; presentation is necessary across most businesses.

If you've got any presentation experience at all, ensure that you include it in your CV if you want to make an impression.

## **Analysed**

[Data](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/big-data-Big-Data) is a vital currency in any organisation, but it's worthless without staff who can analyse it and understand it's implications.

If you have the ability to read data, understand how it affects your employer's business and utilise it to drive positive change, then it will bolster you CV's effectiveness greatly.

## **Developed**

Development drives progress and advancements across all aspects of life.

In business, there is a constant need for the development of new solutions, new technologies, new services, new products and more.

If you can use your CV to draw on specific examples of ideas that you have initiated and developed from inception through to completion; you will prove to recruiters that you have the potential to create a real impact with your work.

## **Use tailored verbs to boost your CV**

You probably won't be able to add all of these verbs to your CV but consider how you could add as many as possible in order to show employers the impact your actions create.
