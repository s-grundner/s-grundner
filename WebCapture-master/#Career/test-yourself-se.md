We've covered a lot of material that was probably brand new to you. Make sure that the concepts are crystal clear by answering the questions below:

### The Principles of Software Engineering

  * How did software engineering actually begin?
  * What processes were early software engineering techniques modeled after?
  * What macro-scale trends helped define the arc of software engineering over the past half-century?
  * What specific advances have led to rapid change in the discipline since the 1990's?
  * What characteristics of the web make modern day web software development more flexible than traditional software?
  * Why are software engineers more like architects than builders?
  * Why are software engineers actually very similar to visual or UX designers in some ways?
  * What are the four steps of the high level engineering problem solving process?
  * What are the specific things you need to do to implement each of these four steps, particularly the first two?
  * Why is thinking about the user so important for engineers?
  * hat does KISS stand for and why do engineers love it?
  * What does DRY stand for and why is it relevant to you?
  * What is "You ain't gonna need it?" (YAGNI)
  * What do you think are the top 3 themes of good software engineering?
  * Why do we say that the engineering approach covers both Product and Process?

  * What is Modularity?
  * How does modularity help us think about systems?
  * What is an Interface?
  * How can the real world be modeled as a modular system?
  * How specific should your modules be?
  * How can you apply modules to your pseudocode "programs"?
  * What is SOA?
  * How was Amazon's transition to using SOA an example of high level modularity at work?
  * Why was it important for Amazon to make this transition?
  * What are the three characteristics of good modules?
  * What is Coupling?
  * How much coupling should good modules have?
  * What is Cohesion?
  * How much cohesion should good systems of modules have?
