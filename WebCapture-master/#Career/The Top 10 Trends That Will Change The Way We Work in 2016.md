## Remote Work

> As an employer, restricting your hiring to a small geographic region means you're not getting the best people you can. As an employee, restricting your job search to companies within a reasonable commute means you're not working for the best company you can.

Stanford University found that remote workers are 13% more productive, take fewer sick days and benefit from a quieter working environment.

Gallup research shows remote workers log more hours and are more engaged.

The Gallup research found that remote employees were only engaged up to a certain point, and that the ideal scenario is to have a balance of both.

Allowing employees to work from home when they want to while having an office they can come back to is important.

## Flexible Work

> We like to give people the freedom to work where they want, safe in the knowledge that they have the drive and expertise to perform excellently, whether they [are] at their desk or in their kitchen. Yours truly has never worked out of an office, and never will.

Companies will start to both take [work-life balance](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/work-life-balance-is-important-for-parents) seriously, and want to maximize the productivity of their employees.

The secret lies in allowing employees to choose their own schedules based on what works best for them, instead of forcing some arbitrary schedule on them.

There are many different tools and resources out there to help make this a smooth process.

## Millennials Have More Power

> It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. Stop settling for what's good enough and start creating art that matters

Luckily, [millennials](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/secret-understanding-millennials) will start taking on more leadership positions as they get older and have more experience.

It's important that you set up a way for them to explore their passions and try things within their time that might not necessarily be status quo.

## Work-Life Balance

> You will never feel truly satisfied by work until you are satisfied by life.

Employee wellness will be the most important topic of 2016. One of the key components of employee wellness is managing stress and making sure employees have enough downtime to be productive.

It might seem counter intuitive to give time off to get more productivity but people need to recharge their batteries or risk [employee burnout](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/dealing-with-employee-burnout).

## Workplace Diversity

> Our workforce and our entire economy are strongest when we embrace diversity to its fullest, and that means opening doors of opportunity to everyone and recognizing that the American Dream excludes no one.

Something interesting to note about diversity is that it's not as bad as it might seem. While most of the data says that it's "white males" in lots of these companies, that can be a bit misleading.

Many of these people are from Europe, Canada, United States, China, etc. So there is some level of diversity, but the assumption is that it's all American white males.

Inclusion and social diversity will become big issues in 2016 and so companies will start to take this seriously.

## Deeper Metrics

> Measure what is measurable and make measurable what is not so.

More companies are getting smarter about which tools they use, and how they connect systems together. Once they connect these systems together, companies can creatively measure many different things to make stronger business cases.

Data has always been an important part of business, but in 2016 it will become even more important.

## Transparency

> A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity.

I strongly believe that [transparency is the one trait that can make or break your business](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/this-one-trait-can-make-or-break-your-business). It's what separates the weak from the strong.

Whether companies like it or not, things are starting to become more transparent. Some companies are resistant to change, and try to hide as much information as they can, but they're only delaying the inevitable.

## Empowered Employees

> It's not the tools you have faith in. Tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's the people you have faith in or not.

With all the research out there now about employee engagement, companies are (finally) placing an even more important focus on employees.

Companies are starting to [empower their employees](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/employee-autonomy-wix) and give them the autonomy they deserve.

Most HR software is starting to be designed with the employee in mind to give them easy access to the information they need.

## Corporate Social Responsibility

> In the next decade, the most successful companies will be those that integrate sustainability into their core businesses.

Many companies are socially responsible today, but now companies will start to focus on this much more.

They'll realize how big of an advantage it is, and consumers will start actively looking for companies that are doing social good.

More companies will see the importance of giving back and implement socially responsible programs.

## Constant Improvement

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but habit.

Companies and teams will be rigorous in how they go about testing and improving themselves.

Using [frequent feedback](https://www.officevibe.com/employee-engagement-solution/employee-feedback), goal-setting, and software to help track all of this, teams will be constantly optimizing the way that they work.

Teams will be focused on constantly improving, using tools like Objectives and Key Results (OKR's).
