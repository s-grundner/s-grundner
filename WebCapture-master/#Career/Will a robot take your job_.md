**Type your job title into the search box below to find out the likelihood that it could be automated within the next two decades.**

About 35% of current jobs in the UK are at high risk of computerisation over the following 20 years, according to a study by researchers at Oxford University and Deloitte.

## Sources

['The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to automation'](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf). Data supplied by Michael Osborne and Carl Frey, from Oxford University's Martin School. Figures on [UK job numbers](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/labour/august-2015/index.html) and [average wages](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dev3/ONS_SOC_occupation_coding_tool.html) from the Office for National Statistics and [Deloitte UK](http://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/growth/articles/from-brawn-to-brains--the-impact-of-technology-on-jobs-in-the-u.html).

## Methodology

Oxford University academics Michael Osborne and Carl Frey calculated how susceptible to automation each job is based on nine key skills required to perform it; social perceptiveness, negotiation, persuasion, assisting and caring for others, originality, fine arts, finger dexterity, manual dexterity and the need to work in a cramped work space.

The research was originally carried out using detailed job data from the United States O*NET employment database. The analysis for UK jobs was made by adapting the findings to corresponding occupations in the UK based on Office for National Statistics job classifications. For the purpose of the UK study, some US occupations were merged. In these cases, the probabilities were calculated as weighted averages of the probabilities of automation for each US occupation within the group.

Some job names have been edited for clarity. Where average salary has been mentioned, the median has been used. Figures are not available for occupations in the military, or for politicians.

*****Where two jobs have the same figure for their risk of automation but are ranked differently this is because the data goes to more than one decimal place.
