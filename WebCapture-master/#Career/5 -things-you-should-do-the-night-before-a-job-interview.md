Preparation is key for having a successful a job interview. What you do the night before a job interview has an impact on your interview. What can you do to make sure this impact is a positive one?

**Get a good night's sleep.**

Getting a good night's sleep is the most important thing you can do before an interview. When you're well rested, you're more alert and focused, and you won't have to resort to caffeine or sugar to stay awake. Being sleep deprived can also increase feelings of stress or anxiety, neither of which is helpful going into a job interview.

Of course, it can be hard to sleep because you're anxious about the interview. If you find yourself having trouble getting to sleep, try a relaxation exercise like meditation or yoga. Whatever you do, take your mind off of the interview - overthinking it is most likely what's keeping you awake.

**Review your resume and cover letter. **

Review your resume and cover letter, as well as any answers to questions you might have filled out on the job application. Focus on key statistics you've listed, major accomplishments, and relevant skills. This is especially important if you're applying to multiple positions and sending out different versions of your resume and cover letter.

By reviewing your documents, they'll be fresh in your mind and you'll be able to answer any questions relating to them quickly. This shows the hiring manager that you are confident, both in your abilities and in the interview itself. If you have to think too hard about a question relating to your resume or cover letter, it could signal to the hiring manager that you weren't truthful on your application and raise a red flag.

**Prepare a list of questions to ask.**

Asking questions is one the most critical things you must do in a job interview, so it's important to prepare some questions in advance. By having a few questions already prepared, you won't draw a blank when the hiring manager asks you. Great questions to ask inquire about the company culture, job responsibilities, or what a typical day looks like. Review the job description to see if there's anything from there that you'd like clarified. This will often be covered during the interview, but if not, you'll be ready to ask about it.

**Plan out your route.**

Plan out your route and how long it will take you to get to the interview location. If you're driving, consider traffic conditions and weather that could cause delays. If you're taking public transportation, check to make sure that the subway or buses are running on schedule and nothing has changed due to planned work. If you're doing a video interview, plan out your location, and check your video and microphone to make sure they work.

Always leave yourself a minimum of 30 extra minutes, regardless of how you're getting to the interview. If you're early, you can find a nearby cafe or just sit in your car and relax. Nothing is worse than stressing about being late, except for actually being late. Avoid both of those things by leaving much earlier than you think you need to. For a video interview, get yourself set up 15 minutes early.

**Plan what you're going to wear.**

Deciding what you're going to wear in advance takes one less thing off of your mind in the morning and allows you to focus your energy on more important things. Make sure your clothes are free of wrinkles, stains, and pet hair. You can also pack your bag the night before, so that all you have to do is grab it and go in the morning.

By starting your interview preparations the night before, you'll be able to focus fully on the interview itself during the day and put 100% of your energy into it.
