We *all* have those days/weeks where our job or situations at work are less than ideal. Most workplace complaints are about: too much work to do, unclear direction or lack of feedback from leadership, bosses, or co-workers. Let's face it too, outside of work, complaining can destroy relationships and ruin a fun night out.

_Real Talk:_ I can be a complainer. I'm a driven, goal-oriented, fast-paced leader. Anything outside of my expectations can cause frustration. That said, I learned that I have to constantly monitor my words and body language to ensure I'm constructive with my feedback and resetting my expectations without sacrificing progress.

Chronic complaining makes things worse, stifles creativity, and can be career limiting.

Here are a few lessons I've learned about chronic complaining:

  * **Your ideas will not be taken as seriously: **If you are seen as a complainer, people will not respect your view the same way they would someone who considers all angles. No matter how great your ideas are, if you are labeled as a complainer, you etch away at your credibility.
  * **Your leadership influence will suffer: **Leaders build trust by "walking the talk." If you are constantly complaining, especially about other colleagues, others will eventually feel like you're talking about them the same way. Do your career a favor and cut out the gossip and backbiting.
  * **You will stop innovation: **Innovation requires fresh ideas. Complainers see what's wrong but can't bring themselves to brainstorm solutions.
  * **You can forget about that promotion: **Rarely do complainers get promoted. Management tends to promote those they can trust -- trust with the responsibilities, but also not get caught up in emotional drama.

I'm NOT saying that we should never complain at work. If you see a problem, bring it to the attention of whoever can do something about it.

However, what we should avoid at all costs, is an attitude of complaining. It has very negative consequences on your career, not to mention your personal wellbeing.
