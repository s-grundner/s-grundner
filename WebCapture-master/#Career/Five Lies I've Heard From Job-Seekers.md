# Five Lies I've Heard From Job-Seekers

Anyone who reads my columns knows how I feel about the broken recruiting process.

They know how I feel about predatory recruiters who tamp down job-seekers' expectations and treat them like cattle.

Recruiting is in shambles. The current corporate and institutional recruiting approach drives the best talent away rather than reeling talent in!

Most companies recruit using horribly outdated, fear-based systems.

When they are ready to dump their talent-repelling recruiting approach, we hear from them, but until then they say "We only do what every other employer does."

Fear and mistrust are baked into the standard recruiting practices.

Everyone is afraid of making one bad hire, when they should be worried about the brilliant and capable people who wouldn't dream of working for them because their recruiting process screams the message "Drop dead!" at job-seekers at every turn.

I speak and write and draw and sing about the need for a more human approach to recruiting.

That's why it kills me when change-averse leaders say "But job candidates lie, and we have to separate the liars from the truth-tellers!"

It kills me because they are right.

You can humanize your recruiting process and I hope you will, but there are indeed job-seekers who lie their way through a recruiting process, causing great disappointment to the people who hire them or nearly hire them and then find out they've been scammed.

It's sad that this happens, but it does.

We helped a client recruit two executives. We had an advisory role in the project. The HR VP from the client firm sent us three resumes to look over.

We opened the resumes. One of the three candidates had worked with me at a past job -- or so her resume said. I focused on her name.

"This makes no sense," I told my colleagues. "If she had that job at that company at that time, I should know her. Her name isn't familiar."

I called an ex-colleague of mine who worked in the division where the job-seeker claimed she also had worked. My ex-colleague said "Yeah, I know her! She was a manager under Marco. You remember Marco, don't you, Liz?"

I did remember him.

The job candidate's resume didn't say "Manager." It said "VP of Marketing."

"She was never VP of Marketing in our company, was she?" I asked.

"No way!" said my friend. "She only stayed about a year. She joined the company as a manager and left it as a manager, too.

"Marco was her boss. He was a Director. Her VP was Allan."

> _"That's why her name didn't sound familiar," I said. I got off the phone._

I checked the candidate's LinkedIn profile. Her LinkedIn profile was a demotion from her resume.

On LinkedIn she gave herself credit for having had Marco's Director job at the company where we worked together.

I looked for Marco as a mutual connection, but the job-seeker was not connected to her old boss on LinkedIn.

That was a smart move on her part. Marco might have objected to his former team member's theft of his title and role during the time they worked together.

I called the HR VP and explained that although I had worked with one of her three candidates several years back, I was positive that her resume details weren't accurate.

Who would take the chance of exaggerating their job title when they worked in a company with thousands of employees -- many of whom use LinkedIn and many of whom might be working in a company Ms. Retroactive Promotion might be targeting?

Our client couldn't care less whether a particular candidate had been a Manager or a VP at an ancient job ten years in the past, but she did care about integrity, and about judgment.

The self-promoting candidate did not get an interview for that job. How many other opportunities has she lost already or could she lose in the future for the same reason?

Other candidates lie about their education. There are a lot of icky-sticky parts to being an HR leader, but surely one of the icky-stickiest is to call an employee into my office and tell him or her that they flunked their background check -- specifically, the education part.

Every college has a Registrar's office. Understandably, colleges don't like it when people claim degrees that they didn't earn.

One time, I got a call from the chief of security at a private college that one of our new hires claimed he had graduated from.

Sadly, he not only hadn't graduated but had never even taken a course at that institution.

The new hire was out of a job less than a week after he started. He tried to fake his way through the meeting with me.

He had photocopied the university's logo on a piece of bond paper and typed up a letter that he said came from a Trustee of the university -- dated the day of our conversation!

"Trustees don't verify academic credentials, particularly not in the form of a personal letter that says that they've known the subject of the investigation since he was a child," I sadly reported.

"Plus, the trustee who signed your letter retired a year ago."

The busted former employee closed his briefcase and left my office and the building. We never heard from him again.

Job-seekers lie about their connections inside the company -- but why?

It's foolish. They will be found out within moments.

People have told me "I know your CFO very well. We've had lunch together several times." Inside I groaned and asked myself "Why? I can check with him in two seconds!"

The CFO would say "Never heard of the guy." I understand that people get fearful.

They feel desperate. But why fabricate a relationship in hopes of winning brownie points? That is a sad and pointless tactic.

Maybe there is a company somewhere where a job-seeker could name-drop using an executive's name and win points for it without having to worry that anyone would ever ask the name-dropped executive "Do you actually know this fellow?"

My view has always been "If you start throwing people's names around, I'd be foolish not to follow up."

An old saying says "When a person shows you who s/he is, believe him (or her)."

Some people lie about their functional expertise. This came through to me most strongly when I interviewed technical folks.

I picked up a lot of technical jargon over the years, but I am not an engineer -- not even close. I know as much about technology as the average avid technology user, but nothing compared to an actual tech person.

However, when I interviewed candidates for a job, I took the time to really understand the job. I had to -- how could I have interviewed people for the job otherwise?

I learned about circuit design and parts libraries, supply chains and production processes and software design protocols.

  


Continued from page 1

I learned about Ohm's Law and seven layers of network protocols and echo cancellation. I learned enough to be able to spot a flim-flammy candidate trying to confuse me with garbled or nonsensical tech terminology.

I wanted to ask these folks "Why? Why take the chance that just because I'm an HR person, young and female, you must inevitably be talking over my head?"

There was no need to impress or dazzle me with fake technical jargon, but these poor candidates tried it anyway and put their flim-flammery on display.

I'd walk each of these folks to his or her hiring manager's office, grab the manager in the hallway for a moment and say "Quiz him on his technical expertise, because he sounds like he is throwing out random words and phrases."

Inevitably the interview feedback sheet came back marked "No Thanks."

It is so much smarter to say "Here's what I understand, and here's what I don't" whenever an interview takes you past your functional or technical comfort level. There's no shame in that.

I have hired many people who simply said "Now you're talking over my head" and were honest about what they knew and didn't know.

There is one more lie that job-seekers often tell during the interview process. They lie about the recruiting process itself.

How or why this gambit originated, I can't tell you. All I know is that some job-seekers have learned to call an HR person like me and say "The VP, Angus, said he wanted to see me this week."

"Thanks for that information," I would say. "Angus is out of the country all week. Maybe there is some confusion."

I have to imagine that somewhere on earth there's a company with HR people so credulous that they could hear a candidate say "The VP said he wants to see me right away!" and actually set up that meeting. I can't picture it, but perhaps it is true.

It's not just other people that candidates will quote when they make the misguided decision to put made-up words in someone's mouth. I've had folks call my teammates in other divisions and use my name the same way. "Your VP Liz Ryan says I'm supposed to be interviewed immediately!"

Everybody knew I never said that. I would never relay a message that way, obviously. The broken job search system is as dysfunctional as any organizational process could ever be, but any instinct to surmount the dysfunction through subterfuge can only hurt you.

Great companies are out there, and you don't even need to submit an online application to reach them. You only need to send a [Pain Letter](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2015/06/06/whats-a-pain-letter-and-can-it-get-me-a-job/) to your hiring manager to get some conversations started.

There's no need to lie or exaggerate at any point in the hiring process.

All that might do is get you hired by people who wouldn't have hired the real you -- and why on earth would you want that?
