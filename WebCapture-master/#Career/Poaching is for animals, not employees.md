# Poaching is for animals, not employees

The language of hiring is broken. From the cog-like "human resources" to the scalp-trophy chase of "head-hunting". Yuck. But no term gets me more riled up than "poaching". It's shockingly revealing: You're an animal, our animal, and other hunters better keep their hands off our property.

WTF.

Employees should go wherever they can get the best deal for themselves. I would! Better deal in the holistic sense of everything that's involved with working for someone else: Most interesting and rewarding work, most freedom in living arrangements, autonomy/responsibility, and, yes, pay and benefits.

If you can only retain employees by fencing them in with non-competes, hiding them away from your about page, or blocking competitive deals from even reaching their attention, well, then you suck.

All your energy should be poured into making sure you have the better deal. That work aligns perfectly with having a better business in general, so it's not like you're taking a detour here.

If you've done all you can, if you sleep sound with a smile knowing you're offering a great deal, then the sting of someone leaving should be manageable too. They found something that was better for them. Be happy! You helped someone get to a better place, and you'll surely be able to find someone else to fill their shoes.

You can't keep everyone forever, and you shouldn't try. That's called captivity. Some people will want to try something else regardless of how good your deal is. That's natural, and fighting it is only going to make matters worse.

So stop nurturing your poaching fears with defensive moves and start putting in the work to make your deal better instead.
