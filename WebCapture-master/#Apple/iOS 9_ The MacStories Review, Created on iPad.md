With iOS entering the last stage of its single-digit version history, it's time to wonder if Apple wants to plant new seeds or sit back, maintain, and reap the fruits of the work done so far.

Last year, [I welcomed iOS 8](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-changed-how-i-work-on-my-iphone-and-ipad/) as a necessary evolution to enable basic communication between apps under the user's control. With extensions based on a more powerful share sheet, document providers, widgets, and custom keyboards, I noted that iOS had begun to open up; slowing down wasn't an option anymore.

In hindsight, many of the announcements from [last year's WWDC](http://www.macstories.net/tag/wwdc-2014/) were unambiguous indicators of a different Apple, aware of its position of power in the tech industry and willing to explore new horizons for its mobile operating system and [what made it possible](http://www.apple.com/swift/).

Following the [troubled launch of iOS 6](http://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ios-6-trilemma/) and subsequent [rethinking of iOS 7](http://www.macstories.net/stories/living-with-ios-7/), Apple found itself caught in the tension between a (larger) user base who appreciated iOS for its simplicity and another portion of users who had elected iPhones and iPads as their primary computers. Alongside this peculiar combination, the tech industry as a whole had seen the smartphone graduate from part of the digital hub to being the hub itself, with implications for the connected home, personal health monitoring, videogames, and other ecosystems built on top of the smartphone.

WWDC 2014 marked the beginning of a massive undertaking to expand iOS beyond app icons. With Extensibility, [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/), [HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/), [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), Tim Cook's Apple drew a line in the sand in June 2014, introducing a new foundation where no preconception was sacred anymore.

iOS' newfound youth, however, came with its fair share of growing pains.

While power users could - [at last](http://www.macstories.net/stories/talking-apps/) - employ apps as extensions available anywhere, the system was criticized for its [unreliability](http://bryan.io/post/97658826431/what-we-learned-building-the-tumblr-ios-share), poor performance, sparse adoption, and general lack of discoverability for most users. The Health app - one of the future pillars of the company's Watch initiative - went through a chaotic launch that caused [apps to be pulled from the App Store](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/17/healthkit-apps-delay/) and [user data to be lost](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6568048). The tabula rasa of iOS 7 and the hundreds of [developer APIs in iOS 8](https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/03/the-growing-ios-sdk/) had resulted in an unprecedented number of bugs and glitches, leading many to call out [Apple's diminished attention](http://sloppyui.tumblr.com/) to software quality. And that's not to mention the fact that new features often made for hefty upgrades, which millions of customers couldn't perform due to [storage size issues](http://osxdaily.com/2014/09/17/ios-8-cannot-install-requires-storage-fix/).

But change marches on, and iOS 8 was no exception. In spite of its problematic debut, iOS 8 managed to reinvent how [I could work from my iPhone and iPad](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-changed-how-i-work-on-my-iphone-and-ipad/), allowing me - and many others - to eschew the physical limitations of desktop computers and embrace mobile, portable workflows that weren't possible before. The past 12 months have seen Apple [judiciously fix](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-releases-ios-8-1-heres-whats-new/), optimize, and [improve](http://www.macstories.net/ios/ios-8-1-1-brings-fixes-for-share-sheet-extension-reordering-icloud-crashes/) several of iOS 8's initial missteps.

Eight years[1](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/) into iOS, Apple is facing a tall task with the ninth version of its mobile OS. After the changes of iOS 7 and iOS 8 and a year before iOS 10, what role does iOS 9 play?

In many cultures, the number "10" evokes a sense of growth and accomplishment, a complete circle that starts anew, both similar and different from what came before. In Apple's case, the company has a sweet spot for the 10 numerology: Mac OS was reborn [under the X banner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X), and it gained a second life [once another 10 was in sight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite).

What [happens](http://io9.com/5881330/what-happened-before-the-big-bang) before a dramatic change is particularly interesting to observe. With the major milestone of iOS 10 on track for next year, what does iOS 9 say about Apple's relationship with its mobile OS _today_?

After two years of visual and functional changes, is iOS 9 a calm moment of introspection or a hazardous leap toward new technologies?

Can it be both?

## Design

From an aesthetic perspective, iOS 9 doesn't drift away from the focus on clarity, content, and color that debuted in 2013. iOS 9's design builds upon the new course of iOS 7, with some notable differences that epitomize Apple's penchant for refinement this year.

### San Francisco

After a short and [public affair with Helvetica Neue](http://typographica.org/on-typography/beyond-helvetica-the-real-story-behind-fonts-in-ios-7/), iOS 9 brings a new system font called [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

Designed in-house by Apple and introduced at WWDC as a family of typefaces that is both "inconspicuous and beautiful", San Francisco is a sans-serif typeface which unifies the typographic voice of iOS, OS X, and watchOS, bringing visual consistency with two distinct sub-families and new APIs for developers to enhance the textual presentation of their apps.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-175805.jpeg)

From an average user's perspective, the change to San Francisco may not appear as a drastic modification to the iOS interface. To people who are not familiar with the intricacies and details of type design, San Francisco may look subtly different, but mostly in line with the neutral and utilitarian nature of Helvetica Neue. This isn't meant to sound as a slight to design experts and type connoisseurs, but a lot of people won't notice the technical detail and years of work behind San Francisco.

![](https://7c8767f40fd77b0a0655-213ce4ca2fa294c548547246ac17375c.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/lock.gif)

From the look of the clock and date on the Lock screen to the time in the status bar and bold labels in title bars, San Francisco refreshes the textual appearance of iOS without clamoring for undivided attention. With San Francisco, iOS 9 doesn't suddenly look like a jailbreak tweak that changes the system font to impractical typefaces just for the sake of customization. San Francisco looks nice - and it is objectively _better_ than Helvetica Neue in some cases - but it doesn't stand out and shout "_Look at me, I'm new!_", and I believe that's exactly what Apple set out to attain in their effort to craft a modern typeface for all their platforms.

With iOS 7 (and 2014's work on OS X Yosemite), Apple's design team strove to build a structure that could forgo realistic representations of objects and textures in favor of a new hierarchy of text and color. While different colors and the interplay of layers have been used to suggest interactivity and depth, the job of communicating hierarchies and relationships between interface elements has largely fallen upon text weights and sizes.

That's why, for instance, title bars feature non-tappable bold titles and regular-sized colored buttons next to them, or why the same font used across three lines, but in different weights, can lay out an email's sender, subject line, and body text preview. Apple discovered that once you get rid of shadows and textures to embellish UIs and push people towards interaction, text itself can be the texture; possibly an even more versatile one, because of its programmability, scalability, and widely recognized properties.

We've seen how third-party apps such as [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) and [Twitterrific](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) gained an identity of their own thanks to the [typefaces](http://concoursefont.com/) they employed. From this standpoint, is it really a surprise that Apple - a company with a knack for controlling the primary technologies of their products - chose to design a new family of typefaces to use everywhere?

That's where San Francisco is worth exploring. Understanding its technicalities can help us comprehend Apple's decisions and appreciate the details that will be shared between the OS and apps.

San Francisco comes in two sub-families: San Francisco, used on iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, and San Francisco Compact, used on Apple Watch. The two variants are related but not equal, with similar designs but different proportions and shapes that can adapt to multiple screen sizes and UI needs.

Each family has, in Apple's parlance, two cuts - Text and Display - with six weights for Text and nine weights for Display. Apple's goal with San Francisco is to bring a consistent voice and reading experience to all platforms; while the typeface stems from a shared set of rules and guidelines, each flavor of San Francisco has been designed and engineered for the platform it'll be displayed on.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-023001.jpeg)

As an artistic expression and software feature, fonts stand at the intersection of craftsmanship and engineering. In designing San Francisco, Apple was tasked with creating a typeface that looked good and was consistent in and out of itself, but that could also scale across three OSes and, more importantly, provide users and developers with controls over font size and readability.

This is one of the core aspects of San Francisco: with an increasing array of screen sizes and ways to personalize the appearance of fonts on iOS, a new family of typefaces ought to solve a problem bigger than nice looks. Text is everywhere, but there's no perfect font size or style that can fit everyone.

Consider Dynamic Type, an [Accessibility](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/) feature introduced in iOS 7 that allows users to change the size of the system font. With a single slider available in the iOS Settings, users can make text bigger or smaller at a system-wide level, achieving a more comfortable reading experience in Apple's apps but also third-party apps which integrate with Dynamic Type.

San Francisco expands upon the idea of ever-changing font sizes with Text and Display, two cuts which are intelligently applied by the system when needed. The main trick employed by Apple is that iOS 9 switches automatically from Display to Text at 20 points. When this threshold is met, Apple "cheats" by altering the font ever so slightly so that it remains readable at smaller sizes. This makes Text suitable for text content displayed at 19 points and below, and Display the best option for labels and other text content displayed at 20 points and above.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-024049.jpeg)

The difference between Text and Display is subtle and it likely won't be noticed by most users, but it contributes to keeping San Francisco readable at any size, in any app, with any Dynamic Type setting. This also means that Text and Display are not equal: when text gets smaller, details of round shapes (such as the terminal of a lowercase "a") get shorter and simplified, while the arm of a lowercase "t" and the shoulder of a lowercase "r" get slightly wider or longer to ensure shapes of letters can be quickly identified when reading. Then, size-specific tracking (the space between letters throughout an entire word, [not to be confused with kerning](https://creativemarket.com/blog/2014/09/18/whats-the-difference-between-leading-kerning-and-tracking)) makes text further spread apart, in order to avoid confusion when reading sentences at a smaller point size.

Apple explained the decision as having to adjust visual perception through illusion. Sometimes you have to cheat to make text look good to the user, and altering some details of San Francisco Display in its dynamic transformation to Text allows the same font to always produce readable text no matter the size.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-025300.jpeg)

If you _really_ want to spot the differences, you can go into Settings > General > Accessibility > Larger Text and have fun moving the slider to see how San Francisco adapts to smaller and bigger sizes. Or, you can pick San Francisco in the new Safari Reader and tweak its size to see how Display and Text come into play and change according to your preference.

To understand the importance of increased detail at a smaller size in a different context, think about the setup process of videogame consoles or accessories like a [Chromecast](http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/) or an Apple TV. When viewed from a distance, lowercase text on TV keyboards can be hard to recognize, especially when your eyesight isn't as good as it used to be. Now, consider that millions of people with visual impairments or low vision may come across similar readability problems on their iOS devices on a daily basis. When bigger text or zoomed UIs aren't an option, having smaller text that is still recognizable and legible becomes essential.

San Francisco's smaller optical size feels airy and with fewer or more details depending on the anatomy of a character. Some of its subtleties will be lost to the average user, but that's the point. People don't have to know how fonts work. They just have to find them readable. And this is true for all kinds of people, with all kinds of needs.

In my tests with apps updated to support the new system font, I found San Francisco to be more comfortable and readable at smaller sizes than other sans-serif typefaces like Helvetica Neue and Avenir. More importantly, San Francisco strikes a good balance of adding fresh personality to the system and keeping an underlying familiarity with previous versions of iOS. It feels more lively, it's not _too_ sharp and geometric, and I find it legible enough at any size.

> _Twitterrific with Helvetica Neue (left) and San Francisco (right)._

For developers, San Francisco offers APIs and features that can be enabled in apps without having to resort to Unicode tricks or fall into limitations of previous system fonts.

Features are behaviors embedded in San Francisco via code; developers can choose to use them or opt out. Some of these features include built-in support for fractions (so developers aren't limited by the choice of [fractions as Unicode glyphs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Forms) and don't have to write custom code to display them), native [superscripts and subscripts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript), alternate 6 and 9 symbols for smaller sizes, proportional numbers by default (but developers can opt into monospaced if they want to), uppercase forms for various math symbols, and a vertically centered colon.

On top of this, San Francisco has comparable vertical metrics to old system fonts for basic compatibility with existing third-party apps and UIKit; it covers Polish, Hungarian, Cyrillic script, Greek script, and more, allowing for consistent localization of apps for international users; and, developers have been given new APIs to access all of the weights available in San Francisco.

I'd like to point out three of the features available in San Francisco, as they have nice, observable properties that anyone can appreciate with enough attention.

The vertically centered colon is used by Apple in typesetting the system clock, and it can always be seen in action in the iOS 9 Lock screen and timestamps in Messages. This is a nice detail which makes for a pleasing viewing experience.

Alternate symbols for 6 and 9 are also interesting as they're already in use by Apple in the Stopwatch app for Apple Watch and on the back of the Watch itself for the serial number. At smaller sizes, the similarly curved shape of these two numbers can be easily confused, and the alternate look (opt-in for developers) enables flatter, discernible shapes with lower cognitive load.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-030532.jpeg)

Monospaced and proportional numbers aren't exactly new in iOS 9: Helvetica Neue supported switching from monospaced to proportional in iOS 8, but the default behavior has changed in iOS 9. Now, the system defaults to displaying proportional numbers: in most cases, proportional numbers (with variable width) are more evenly spaced with fewer unusual gaps between them than monospaced (fixed width) counterparts. If a series of numbers is rendered proportionally, a skinny "1" won't take up the same width of a larger "5", leading to a more pleasant effect.

There are instances in which monospaced numbers would be preferable (such as columns in spreadsheets or animations in progress bars), but for most cases of body text and labels (and the system clock), proportional numbers as the default option is the right move.

To better showcase the capabilities of San Francisco in iOS 9, I asked [Daniel Breslan](http://breslan.co.uk/app.php), an independent developer who works on [Departure Board](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/departure-board-instant-train/id954492323?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) for iPhone, to create a sample app for iOS 9 and compare San Francisco to the same text strings and layout of an iOS 8 app with Helvetica Neue.

![iOS 8 \(left\) and iOS 9 \(right\).](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-031253.jpeg)

> _The same custom app, running on iOS 9 for iPad._

This was a fun experiment as it shows how tracking, Text and Display cuts, and font features affect apps in practice. In the screenshots above, you can see how San Francisco adds a bit of personality to an otherwise neutral typeface, with details such as fractions, superscripts, subscripts, and alternate 6 and 9 making for a superior reading and formatting experience in iOS 9.

Today, it seems obvious that Apple wanted to control the typographic destiny of its ecosystem. Our experience with iOS devices primarily involves reading text. Whenever we pick up an iPhone or iPad and we look at something, text is part of it. Text is communication, texture, and call to action. Text has established a new visual hierarchy since iOS 7, but Apple wasn't directly in control of its appearance and functionality. With San Francisco, Apple has set out to design a typeface that's familiar, flexible, elegant, and accessible.

The details of San Francisco may go unnoticed in the general public, but by claiming control of the system font, Apple is allowing developers to spend less time dealing with code required to build features that are native in San Francisco, letting them focus on other parts of their apps. This is a common thread in iOS 9, and an expected next step given the maturity and reach of the iOS ecosystem in 2015.

  


### Keyboard

Another San Francisco-related change in iOS 9 that demands a standalone section is Apple's response to criticism on the Shift key design of iOS 8.

The solution proposed by the company in iOS 9 is twofold. As far as the Shift key is concerned, iOS 9 introduces a simpler design that makes its On/Off state more obvious. When turned off, the Shift key has a gray background with a hollow glyph that matches the adjacent keys. When turned on, the entire key turns white with a black, filled glyph.

![The new Shift key design in iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-040213.jpeg)

> _The new Shift key design in iOS 9._

The new design clearly indicates the activation state of the Shift key, and it goes a long way in removing doubts on whether Shift is enabled or not, solving a major usability issue of the iOS 7/8 keyboard.

iOS 9 also brings a feature which has been a staple of keyboards on Android, other OSes, and even videogame consoles for decades: lowercase and uppercase letters on the keyboard.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-054041.jpeg)

Apple has added lowercase and uppercase variations of San Francisco letters to the iOS keyboard, turning on the option by default. With a default configuration, this means that when typing on iOS 9 - on either the iPhone or iPad - keys will constantly switch from uppercase to lowercase letters.

Critics of this design choice will argue that switching between uppercase and lowercase characters looks garish and fiddly, that Android has featured a similar behavior for years, and that such keyboard design loses the purity of the original iPhone's keyboard. I understand the conceptual premise of this argument, but it dismisses the actual benefit of the new keyboard design in iOS 9.

Animating characters between uppercase and lowercase transitions may not look as polished and precise as an always-uppercase keyboard, but it's more practical. I'm used to looking at uppercase and lowercase characters every day, and I don't mind seeing this on the iOS keyboard. The [affordance](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/affordances-matter/) is simply stronger and more natural.[2](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/3/) It's faster to look at lowercase keys and expect lowercase characters to be entered on screen as a result of my direct manipulation than having to guess the output of my typing based on the Shift key alone.[3](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/3/)

This is the very advantage of software keyboards: they can be updated via software. For eight years, the iPhone's keyboard was stuck on imitating the hardware keyboards of Macs, with uppercase keys that look bigger and better but that can't be updated or changed dynamically. Alternating between lowercase and uppercase characters is just another case of a right thing to do because iOS doesn't have to be like a PC.

Apple is making this an option, at least for now. If you're unhappy with the new keyboard design in iOS 9, you can go into Settings > General > Accessibility > Keyboard and turn off 'Show Lowercase Keys'. This will turn off alternate lowercase and uppercase letters, but it won't apply to third-party custom keyboards from the App Store.

![Left: Character Preview turned on.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-040113.jpeg)

> _Left: Character Preview turned on._

Apple has also added an option to disable Character Preview, the little popup that appears every time you tap a letter on your iPhone's keyboard. This is likely a consequence of having lowercase and uppercase letters - it's no longer of paramount importance to confirm the character that is being typed when you're looking at a keyboard that adapts to each case.

If you're okay with this option, you can turn off Character Preview in Settings > General > Keyboard.[4](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/3/)

### Rounded Corners

With the exception of San Francisco, the overall look of iOS isn't changing in version 9.0, but floating menus and sheets have received rounder corners and stronger drop shadows that make them stand out against the background of an app.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-041850.jpeg)

As a result, buttons in menus are taller and they look more like buttons, inviting users to tap on them.[5](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/3/)

The change is subtle but noticeable, and I've been thinking about _why_ Apple has decided to bring this to iOS 9 when there doesn't seem to be any official update to the design guidelines of iOS.

![Sweet, sweet buttons.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-054301.jpeg)

> _Sweet, sweet buttons._

The explanation I came up with is that every major Apple software redesign tends to overshoot and dial back over time, dampening the most radical aspects to readjust what was probably exaggerated in the first version. Alerts and sheets had a serious depth problem in iOS 7 and iOS 8, and they could be confused with the rest of an app.

But I also believe the iPad motivated this change: with the device now capable of showing multiple apps and sheets on screen at the same time, making each element independent from what's underneath it is going to be crucial for clarity. Bigger, rounded menus with drop shadows look nicer and they also serve a purpose. I wouldn't be surprised to see more updates along these lines in future versions of iOS.

  4. Unlike iOS 8, you can slide your finger across buttons without lifting it off the screen, and you'll be able to select different buttons when sliding. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/3/)
  


## Safari

Since [switching to Safari as my default browser](http://www.macstories.net/stories/leaving-google-chrome-why-ive-returned-to-safari/) two years ago, I've often called it Apple's best app on iOS. While the "best" monicker may be up for debate, Safari _is_ my favorite Apple app: its elegant interface hides a considerate collection of gestures and menus that make reading and browsing a pleasure, especially on the iPad. Alongside [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), Safari is where I get most of my work done on iOS. Unlike [some](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks), as a heavy user first and a publisher second, I believe that Safari showcases Apple at its best on iOS.

With iOS 9, Apple isn't rethinking any core aspect of Safari _the app_: they have brought some nice changes and additions to how you use Safari and what you can do with it, but together they make for an iterative update that doesn't include any major visual tweaks.

Where Apple has taken a bold new direction is in what you can see when using Safari and how the power of Safari can be extended to other iOS apps. Here lie two of the biggest surprises of iOS 9 - and, potentially, a harbinger of the future of web publishing.

Safari Reader, the company's tool to clean up articles on the web for a clutter-free reading experience, has been updated in iOS 9 to include new font options and backgrounds. Functionally, Safari Reader is still the same: you tap a button in the address bar (if available) to clean up an article, and the app generates an elegant, text-and-images-only version that strips out all extraneous content.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-150107.jpeg)

iOS 9 provides a total of eight fonts (including San Francisco), four backgrounds, and 12 font sizes you can use in Safari Reader. The configuration you pick applies to every instance of Safari Reader on your device.

While Safari Reader doesn't offer the typographic controls of [Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) (my preferred reading experience for web articles), the improvements in iOS 9 make it more versatile and capable of adapting to different users. Font options and backgrounds could help users with visual impairments tweak Safari Reader to yield a superior combination of text and colors for higher readability.

I don't use Safari Reader every day - I prefer reading long-form articles in dedicated apps like Instapaper and Pocket - but when I come across the occasional article that I want to read right away, I remember how _nice_ Safari Reader is. I may not be a heavy user of it, but Reader is a solid Safari feature and the changes in iOS 9 are good ones.[6](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/4/)

![Tap & hold, Paste and Go.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-150616.jpeg)

> _Tap_

A great little touch in Safari for iOS 9 is a way to quickly open a URL or a new search query. If you have a link copied in the clipboard, you can tap & hold the address bar and hit "Paste and Go" to navigate to the copied link directly. This is a fantastic shortcut that has made me save several seconds every day: before iOS 9, I had to select the address bar, select all text, paste, and hit Return. In iOS 9, the same result can be achieved in two taps.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-150804.jpeg)

Safari is also smart in recognizing whether you're holding the address bar with a URL or some text in your clipboard. If what you've copied isn't a URL, "Paste and Search" will be an option instead. This lets you look up what you've copied on the default Safari search engine.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-173559.jpeg)

Even if you don't need to paste URLs or search terms, you can still tap & hold the address bar to get a 'Copy' button that lets you copy the current webpage to your clipboard.

With iOS 9, Apple has also changed two other Safari features - "Request Desktop Site" and "Find on Page". Both options are now available as action extensions in the share sheet; the updated placement makes them more visible and puts the spotlight on the share sheet, which too many users are still unaware of.

Both features can also be activated in other ways. "Find on Page" can still be accessed by typing any word in the address bar and tapping the 'On This Page' result at the bottom of the list.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-151457.jpeg)

Apple's designers got more creative with the alternate location for "Request Desktop Site": if you tap & hold the refresh icon in the address bar, you'll get a shortcut to get the desktop version of the webpage you're viewing. This is another handy time-saving tweak, and it makes sense to bundle it with the refresh icon as requesting a desktop site does refresh the current page.

An important addition to iOS 9's Safari (that is hopefully not going to be seen a lot) is detection of phishing attempts. When visiting a website that has been reported as phishing and is likely trying to trick users into disclosing personal information, Safari will turn red. The browser's not blushing - it's automatically preventing the website from loading. In this special view, Apple has included links to learn more about phishing scams, report an error, go back in navigation, or continue anyway.

![Pro tip: never visit this site. Unless you have to write a review of iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-054459.jpeg)

> _Pro tip: never visit this site. Unless you have to write a review of iOS 9._

This is a good move, and changing the color of the UI helps in paying attention to what's happening on a potentially malicious webpage. The Safari team put a lot of thought into this: the share sheet will be disabled as well, preventing users from sharing the URL with others or mistakenly adding the website to their bookmarks.

The other changes in Safari for iOS 9 are in line with the "small and nice to have" nature of updates in this release. If you're using Safari with an external keyboard, you can select results in the address bar with the Up/Down arrows and confirm your choice using Return - this change alone allows me to use Safari with my Belkin keyboard more consistently as I rarely have to touch the screen.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-173821.jpeg)

If you have multiple usernames and passwords saved for a website, Safari's autofill will put up a new Passwords button to view the logins you've stored and pick a password to log into the current webpage.

Unfortunately, this collection of minor changes is all there is to Safari in terms of core app updates. There's still no way to properly manage file downloads - truly an inexplicable decision now that iOS 9 offers plenty of choice with extensions and an iCloud Drive app to manage files. It's absurd that, in 2015, if you want to download a bunch of files from the web on an iPad, you need a third-party app.

Unlike [its counterpart on El Capitan](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html), Safari on iOS 9 doesn't offer the ability to pin tabs to the leftmost side of the tab bar - a feature I would have liked to see on the iPad. Among all the new keyboard shortcuts in the app (there's even one to show and dismiss Safari Reader), there still isn't one to activate the share sheet and use extensions with the keyboard - an oversight I'd like to see fixed in the near future.

Thankfully, what Apple didn't bring to Safari in iOS 9 is offset by features to extend the browser in new ways.

  1. I'm curious about the ability for developers to initialize Safari Reader programmatically, perhaps with a custom button. I haven't seen this done anywhere yet, but it [should be possible](https://twitter.com/rmondello/status/621523501665550337). [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/4/)
  


### Content Blockers

Safari on iOS 9 supports a new type of extension: Content Blockers. By content blocking, Apple means the ability for Safari to identify subsets of content or resources on a webpage to hide them or prevent them from being loaded altogether. Through an extension that provides a set of triggers and actions, Safari can block cookies, images, scripts, pop-ups, and other content with CSS overrides and full resource blocking.

On the surface, Content Blockers may be viewed as ad blockers for iOS, and that's likely going to be their most popular use case, but they can do much more than simply blocking ads on webpages.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-174302.jpeg)

Content Blockers, like any other extension on iOS, are installed from apps you download from the App Store. An app can offer a Content Blocker extension, which you can activate in Settings > Safari > Content Blockers.

Content Blockers are based on a fast, memory efficient model that informs Safari on what to hide or block ahead of time rather than requiring Safari to consult with an app while loading a webpage. To create a Content Blocker, developers have to provide a JSON object that contains dictionaries of triggers and actions; this is then compiled into [bytecode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode), which can be evaluated very efficiently by Safari. For performance reasons, Content Blockers are only available for apps compiled to run on 64-bit architectures, supported by the following devices:

  * iPhone 5s
  * iPhone 6
  * iPhone 6 Plus
  * iPhone 6s
  * iPhone 6s Plus
  * iPad Air
  * iPad Air 2
  * iPad Pro
  * iPad mini 2
  * iPad mini 3
  * iPad mini 4
  * iPod touch 6

In addition, Content Blockers are supported in Safari and the modern Safari View Controller; they're not available in legacy web views built using [UIWebView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIWebView_Class/) and [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WebKit/Reference/WKWebView_Ref/).

The model behind Content Blockers is aimed at being faster and more private than existing content blocking extensions for desktop browsers. In addition to not having to consult with a full app while loading a webpage - a task that would increase RAM and battery consumption - what the user does inside Safari is never exposed to Content Blockers. The URLs of webpages that users view in Safari with a Content Blocker installed are never passed by Safari to the Content Blocker itself. The only job of a Content Blocker is to provide a dictionary of rules; Safari takes care of everything else.

The actual rules that build a Content Blocker are organized in triggers and actions. Triggers can be filters for specific URLs, resource types (such as scripts or media), load types (first-party for resources from the same domain, or third-party from external domains), as well as filters to apply to a specific domain or to other domains except a specific one. Filters can be combined in a dictionary by a Content Blocker: for example, an app could assemble a trigger for all third-party scripts on amazon.com or a trigger that uses a regular expression to hide instances of the word "espresso" on every website _except_ macstories.net.

As for actions, Content Blockers can either apply a CSS override (using `css-display-none`) to hide content or block matched content defined in the trigger. When blocking a resource, Safari won't just load it and hide it in the background: it'll completely prevent the matched resource from loading. From a technical standpoint, the Safari team has done a great job at making Content Blockers easy to build, fast, and private. Even non-developers can look at [the JSON object powering a Content Blocker](https://gist.github.com/CraftyDeano/777579c628b3d8d50f25) and grasp what's going to happen once activated.

Content Blockers are a byproduct of the modern web. Given the astronomic rise of web advertising and businesses based on tracking user behavior and personal information through scripts embedded on webpages, there has been a considerable [growth in the average size](https://gigaom.com/2014/12/29/the-overweight-web-average-web-page-size-is-up-15-in-2014/) of webpages in recent years. It's not uncommon to come across a webpage that goes over 10 MB of data for all the external scripts, resources, and media that a browser needs to load even if they aren't necessarily part of the content the user is interested in.

The name 'Content Blocker' is something of a misnomer, since this feature isn't meant to hide or block _content_, as most people would define it. Instead, they act on ads or scripts which often _do_ block content, such as a popup image which covers what you are trying to read.

Content Blockers can also hide any page content with CSS overrides. If you've ever wanted to be able to hide comments, social buttons, sidebars you don't care about, or interactive galleries from your favorite websites, Content Blockers will offer a way to do so with a few rules.

Right or wrong, this is what Content Blockers are: Safari extensions that can hide or block content with good performance and user privacy in mind. Rather than dwelling on the moral aspects of this technology, I set out to discover if Apple's claims were reflected in Content Blockers built by developers for iOS 9.

Since June, I've been testing eight Content Blockers for iPhone and iPad. There was a lot of overlap between them: most developers I spoke with were building Content Blockers aimed at blocking ads and trackers, using public rules available from [EasyList and EasyPrivacy](https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/). Content Blockers that only focused on blocking ads and scripts through those databases worked fine, but one was comparable to the other - and I suspect we're going to see a lot of Content Blockers that use EasyList and EasyPrivacy with a minimal UI to wrap it all together.

![1Blocker is a highly customizable Content Blocker.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-053335.jpeg)

> _1Blocker is a highly customizable Content Blocker._

Curious to have a better understanding of Content Blockers, I tried some that went beyond simple ad/tracker blocking and that incorporated CSS overrides, specific resource blocking, and user-defined filters. I ended up using two Content Blockers for this review:

  * [1Blocker](http://1blocker.com/), an excellent all-in-one Content Blocker that can block ads, trackers, social widgets, Disqus comments, web fonts, adult sites, and that lets you create your own rules for URLs, cookies, and page elements to hide or block. [1Blocker is Universal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-block-ads-tracking/id1025729002?ls=1&mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) and it comes with over 7000 built-in rules, which you can individually turn on and off.
  * Shut Up, an iOS version of the [popular stylesheet by Steven Frank](https://stevenf.com/shutupcss/) that hides comments from hundreds of websites and commenting systems.

With these Content Blockers installed, I ran tests on a few websites I frequently visit that heavily rely on third-party ads, tracking networks, and external resources. For some of them, I also applied custom CSS overrides to make the content more pleasing to my eyes, which involved hiding sidebars, comment sections, footers, and other boxes of content I didn't care about.

Apple makes it easy to test Content Blockers and measure their performance: with a Content Blocker installed, a tap & hold on the refresh icon in the Safari address bar will reveal a second option to reload the current webpage _without_ Content Blockers. This shortcut comes in handy if a site becomes problematic after blocking some of its content, but it can also be used with Safari's Web Inspector on OS X to measure resources, size of resources, and time until the [load event fired](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load) with and without Content Blockers.

All of the following tests were performed on an iPad Air 2, on a Wi-Fi network, with caching enabled.

For context, you can also take a look at screenshots of a few websites before and after applying Content Blockers. Changes include both blocked resources and elements hidden via CSS.

The numbers above speak for themselves. I started using Content Blockers on my iPhone and iPad in June. Two weeks ago, out of curiosity, I decided to disable them for a few days to monitor my reaction. That's when I realized I'm not going to disable Content Blockers if the web doesn't improve in the foreseeable future.

I've gotten used to seeing webpages load in two seconds again. For the first time in years, I haven't exceeded my monthly data cap, with hundreds of MBs of data left in my plan. In the long run, Content Blockers will give me back dozens of minutes I haven't spent waiting for content to load alongside ads and trackers.

Effectively, using Content Blockers on iOS 9 feels like getting a new web. Lighter, faster, more private, and less cluttered.

And that's where I feel bad, and where the entire discussion about Content Blockers lies. I don't feel good knowing that, by using Content Blockers, I'm not supporting my favorite sites through the ad and tracking-based business model they opted for. After all, if an article on the web is given to me for free, what right do I have to complain about the means used to monetize it?

On the other hand, though, this is _my_ time and _my_ cellular data - money out of my pocket - and the ad-supported web has gotten out of hand. As a user _and_ website owner, a simple article with three paragraphs of text and one image shouldn't weigh 5 MBs and take 20 seconds to load. I can't accept webpages that continue processing network requests in the background for over a minute, consuming battery on a device that I may need at the end of the day for an emergency. I'm all for ad-based business models - this very website is partially supported by sponsors - but is there really no better, more tasteful, less intrusive way to run a website than what we're seeing on the web today?

As a user, am I supposed to feel bad about Content Blockers and not use them at the risk of wasting data and battery life, or should I fight back?

![Some websites can change a lot with Content Blockers.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-031645.jpeg)

> _Some websites can change a lot with Content Blockers._

Apple's answer seems clear. With iOS 9, Apple is not pre-installing any Content Blockers in Safari, and I'd be surprised if they'll ever actively promote one on the App Store. But they have made it _ridiculously_ easy to install and use one, with benefits that aren't conceptual or limited to power users - everyone understands more battery and less data. When the majority of iOS users will realize that Content Blockers make Safari and the web faster and lighter, I can't imagine why they wouldn't want to use one. And, I bet, most of them won't feel as bad as I did when writing this review. They won't add sites to whitelists like I did, to enable ads on them. They won't care about the business model of a website. They'll just enjoy the cleaner, lighter web made possible by Content Blockers.

Apple is killing the proverbial two birds with one stone here. By building Content Blockers as extensions bundled inside apps and prioritizing user privacy and performance over anything else, they are leveraging the App Store to let users discover and install Content Blockers, which can't observe what a user does in Safari. This is quite a change from popular desktop blockers that, by evaluating rules while a webpage is being loaded, can track user behavior and URLs.

Also, by making them exclusive to Safari, Content Blockers will likely create a powerful network effect: when users of third-party browsers on iOS (possibly made by a [company](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/mobile/) _based_ on ads) will know that only Safari supports Content Blockers, I bet that millions of them will switch to Apple's browser.

Apple described Content Blockers as a way to add something to the experience of a webpage "by taking something away". I'm okay with what's being taken away, and my devices are better because of it. Content Blockers are a win-win scenario for Apple and users. As for web publishers...The times, they are a-changin'.

  


### Safari View Controller

With iOS 9, Apple wants to reimagine in-app web views using the interface, features, performance, and security of Safari. To do so, they've built Safari View Controller - a Safari view that lives inside an app and that runs in a secure, isolated process.

![Left: standard Safari View Controller. On the right, Safari View Controller with a custom tint color set by an app.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-214108.jpeg)

> _Left: standard Safari View Controller. On the right, Safari View Controller with a custom tint color set by an app._

With Safari View Controller, Apple is giving developers a way out from custom web views, allowing them to stop building miniature web browsers with less functionality than the system browser. As I [detailed](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-and-safari-view-controller-the-future-of-web-views/) earlier this year, this has major implications for how the web is embedded and experienced in iOS apps.

Safari View Controller has been closely modeled after Safari with consistency and quick interactions in mind. Safari View Controller looks a lot like Safari: when users tap a web link in an app that uses it, they'll be presented with a Safari view that displays the address bar at the top and other controls at the bottom or next to it.

![Safari View Controller looks a lot like Safari.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-054757.jpeg)

> _Safari View Controller looks a lot like Safari._

Safari View Controller mostly looks like Safari for iPhone and iPad: on the iPad, navigation controls, the address bar, and a share icon live in an address bar at the top; on the iPhone, navigation and share buttons are displayed at the bottom. Both flavors of Safari View Controller come with a Done button to dismiss the browser in a consistent position at the top right.

There are two minor differences with Safari: when opened in Safari View Controller, the URL in the address bar will be grayed out to indicate it's in read-only mode; while users can navigate to other links in a webpage displayed in Safari View Controller, they can't tap the address bar to manually type a URL or start a new search. And, a Safari button is available in the toolbar, so that users can jump to Safari if they want to continue viewing the current webpage in the browser.

In addition, Apple is making sure that user privacy and security are highly valued in how Safari View Controller operates. Safari View Controller runs in a separate process from the host app, which is unable to see the URL or user navigation happening inside it (same concept of Content Blockers). Therefore, Apple has positioned Safari View Controller as entirely safe: private user data stays in Safari and is never exposed to a third-party app that wants to open a link with Safari View Controller. This is an important difference from custom web views (built using legacy APIs such as UIWebView and last year's WKWebView) that are adopted by millions of apps, including those of big companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

The considerations behind Safari View Controller have allowed Apple to port much of the polish and functionality that users know (and expect) from Safari to any app that uses Safari View Controller in iOS 9.

> _Safari View Controller in Twitterrific. Notice the WordPress toolbar because I'm already logged into MacStories._

Safari View Controller shares cookies and website data with Safari. If a user is already logged into a specific website in Safari and a link to that website is opened in Safari View Controller, the user will already be logged in. Safari View Controller has access to iCloud Keychain's password autofill, plus contact card and credit card autofill, Safari Reader, and the system share sheet for action and share extensions. If Private Browsing mode is enabled in Safari and a user opens a webpage in Safari View Controller, it'll open in Private Browsing as well.

> _Safari View Controller in Private Browsing mode, showing Safari Reader and the system share sheet._

Like Safari, Safari View Controller supports detection of phishing websites, it has a nice built-in progress bar, and it also provides custom views for errors and other issues in webpages. To top off everything that's shared between Safari and Safari View Controller, Content Blockers you activate in Safari will be enabled for Safari View Controller, too - by itself, a huge incentive to start using it.

Safari View Controller isn't without its fair share of issues and questionable design decisions. First and foremost, it doesn't give developers too much control over the visual appearance and behavior of the in-app web browser.

Developers can style Safari View Controller with a custom tint color: they change the color of buttons to match their app's main color, and that's it. They can't change the color of the entire UI or insert custom interface elements in the toolbars. This helps with consistency in that Safari View Controller closely resembles Safari - therefore giving users a sense of security and familiarity - but the effect can be somewhat jarring if the host app's interface wholly differs from the look of Safari.

At a technical level, because Safari View Controller doesn't expose anything about the webpage being loaded, apps that use it have no control over caching and they can't use webpage information in any way beside letting users share what they're viewing with a share sheet (which is also sandboxed). Again, this was done in the name of security and performance: there are trade-offs involved to provide users with a way to open webpages with a Safari view using shared credentials, the Nitro rendering engine, Content Blockers, and everything that comes with Safari.

Safari View Controller opens modally on top of the host app, with the only way to dismiss it being a 'Done' button at the top of the screen. Developers can't use custom gestures to dismiss Safari View Controller - such as the popular swipe from the left edge - and they can't put it inside an app's view so users can move back and forth between other views and Safari View Controller. If you're used to being able to [open a web view in Tweetbot and switch to another tab](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all/) while the webpage is open, prepare to say goodbye to that ability if Tweetbot implements iOS 9's new web view. Safari View Controller is modal, and the webpage completely takes over the host app functionally _and_ visually.

Aside from the shortcomings I've already mentioned for Safari, my main problem with Safari View Controller is that it lacks one essential Safari shortcut I've come to rely upon. Unlike Safari, you can't tap & hold the refresh icon in the Safari View Controller address bar to request a desktop site or reload a webpage without Content Blockers.

Another issue is that, currently, the [1Password extension won't show up in Safari View Controller](https://twitter.com/1Password/status/642338528068808704) as it's unable to fill the contents of a webpage with user information. This can be a major annoyance if you don't use iCloud Keychain in addition to 1Password, but it hasn't been a problem for me as I always save passwords filled by 1Password in iCloud Keychain as well. If you're already logged in via Safari, you will be logged in via Safari View Controller.

Despite these limitations, the benefits of Safari View Controller are too convenient for developers to ignore.

I've been able to test beta versions of my favorite apps with Safari View Controller support, including [Twitterrific](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), [Dispatch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dispatch-email-meets-gtd-textexpander/id642022747?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), and [Terminology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminology-3-extensible-dictionary/id687798859?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline). After getting used to the speed and convenience of Safari View Controller, I don't want to go back to custom web views.

When I tap a link in my Twitter stream and it opens the same webpage I'd see in Safari, it feels like the web is better integrated across the entire OS rather than split in a bunch of proprietary renditions of it. Webpages open fast; I'm already logged into websites I know; and, I have native access to features like Safari Reader, extensions, and Content Blockers. With Safari View Controller, I don't have to learn a new web view every time I use a different app. Safari - and everything I like about it - comes along for the trip, giving me performance and functionalities I expect from my iOS browser.

There are apps in which Safari View Controller won't be a suitable option. Editorial's built-in web browser, for instance, supports multiple tabs and access to webpage content with JavaScript, both of which can't be implemented in Safari View Controller. I wouldn't want to see apps like Editorial abandon their advanced web views just for the sake of adopting Safari View Controller. But in most cases, apps that only display one webpage at a time will be better off using Safari View Controller, as it offers a consistent interface, speed, and a safer environment for users. At this point, I'm just annoyed whenever I come across an iOS 9 app that doesn't use Safari View Controller to open links.

![Editorial's browser has tabs and custom integrations that won't be available in Safari View Controller.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-11-220336.jpeg)

> _Editorial's browser has tabs and custom integrations that won't be available in Safari View Controller._

Though I'd like Apple to address them, the potential issues of Safari View Controller haven't been showstoppers in daily usage. At the cost of losing custom branding and custom menus in web views, I now prefer following links that open in Safari View Controller because I feel safe knowing that it's Safari, and because I know the webpage will be displayed exactly like I want it to be.

If anything, the biggest problem of Safari View Controller is that I doubt companies with a vested interest in custom features and user tracking will use it. Just like iOS 8 extensions didn't provide developers with data about user behavior, which resulted in the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Pinterest not using them (or taking a long time to support them - with [a different tactic](http://www.macstories.net/ios/twitter-adds-ios-8-share-sheet-support-to-iphone-app/)), I wonder if Safari View Controller adoption will be slowed down by an unwillingness to support a sandboxed web view.

[We're already seeing the kind of argument](https://openradar.appspot.com/21349835) these companies have against Safari View Controller, and I'm afraid it could remain a niche feature of iOS 9 for millions of users. I'll be happy to be proven wrong here.

Safari View Controller solves two problems. Apple wants to give developers a way to focus on other parts of their apps' code, leaving the job to display web content to a browser that has been refined and improved over the years. At the same time, their goal is to give users a consistent, safe, and fast way to open webpages with the functionality they already know.

Content Blockers and Safari View Controller draw a line in the sand between web companies and users. Apple has chosen to give users the power to fight back and enjoy a faster, safer web. The ball is in the developers' court now.

  


## The State of Share Sheets

Last year's most notable addition to iOS - action and share extensions - came from an unsuspected place: the share sheet Apple had long used to let users share photos and text with preinstalled actions.

It wasn't an optimal solution, though: the one-size-fits-all approach of the share sheet meant developers had to cope with issues related to how different inputs were passed to extensions; the share sheet's design caused discoverability concerns as many users couldn't understand how to enable extensions. Apple built a framework for action and share extensions, tied it to the share sheet, and left developers and users to deal with [figuring out how it worked](http://bryan.io/post/97658826431/what-we-learned-building-the-tumblr-ios-share).

iOS 9 only partially addresses these issues. For developers, iOS 9 has a new dictionary API that lets extensions show up even if they only accept one of multiple input representations shared by an app. This is aimed to fix the paradox of developers who, to be good platform citizens, made their apps share data in multiple formats and ended up punishing users because iOS 8 extensions had to support every single input format to appear in the share sheet.

Imagine an app that can share text in multiple formats such as TXT, PDF, and HTML. In iOS 8, an extension needed to support all formats to be an option in the share sheet triggered in the host app; in iOS 9, the new dictionary API enables extensions to be available in the share sheet even if they only support one of multiple representations shared by the host app.

If adopted by developers (the feature is opt-in), iOS 9 extensions should be available in more places. For users, this could mean fewer mysterious disappearances of icons from the share sheet depending on the app they use. Alas, I wasn't able to test this during the summer as I couldn't get my hands on enough betas of apps with support for the new extension dictionary API.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-032552.jpeg)

Another share sheet-related change in iOS 9 is the ability to open it from a new "Share" option of the copy & paste menu. This way, apps that chose to avoid share sheet integration in iOS 8 (such as Apple's own Mail and Reminders) will feature extension support in iOS 9 as long as they allow users to select text. It also makes it more obvious that it's possible to share selected text through extensions instead of having to reach for a separate share icon.

This is a welcome tweak, with some reservations. The new menu-triggered share sheet doesn't expose all the information that is available from the regular share sheet. For instance, if you select some text on a webpage in Safari and hit the share icon in the top toolbar, extensions will be able to see a variety of data about text selected on the webpage, the URL, HTML code, and more.

![A share sheet in Mail for iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-032648.jpeg)

> _A share sheet in Mail for iOS 9._

If you select text in a webpage and share with the new menu button, only selected text will be passed to extensions as plain text, with no additional webpage information embedded in it. The same happens for any app that works with formatted text: you can try this yourself by sharing some rich text from an email message to the Mail extension itself ([Mail inside Mail](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e2jtHQ_mg-8/UTiAe8lrCDI/AAAAAAAAD70/y3ZG2PW3dk0/s1600/leonardo-dicaprio-inception-movie-meme-face.jpg) is now possible, too).

Apple isn't backing away from the share sheet, nor are they making considerable changes to the way extensions can be discovered, managed, and activated. Developers still have no way to programmatically trigger specific extensions or take users directly to the share sheet's configuration screen; users need to manually open the share sheet's setting view to toggle action and share extensions on and off.

Extensions remain one of the most powerful technologies of iOS. But as [I've argued before](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-wishes/), they'll have to break out of the share sheet sooner or later to embrace a wider audience. I was hoping iOS 9 would mark the framework's maturity with the ability to customize how extensions are activated while keeping everything safe and consistent, but I'll have to postpone my hopes until next year.

## The State of Reminders

Apple's Reminders app hasn't witnessed a meaningful alteration in iOS 9, carrying over the same design introduced with iOS 7 in 2013 (paper texture included) and keeping a structure based on lists. What Reminders does gain in iOS 9, though, is a new way to capture any kind of information from apps through a universal interaction layer - Siri.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-150826.jpeg)

In iOS 9, you can create smart reminders in any app by summoning Siri and saying "remind me about this". Through that sentence, Siri will capture the state of your current app activity - a webpage in Safari, a message in Mail, a view in a third-party app - and it'll save it as a reminder that includes the app icon and a link to reopen the view from the originating app. Smart reminders are supported across every iOS app, and a due date or time can be appended to the Siri query, too. After issuing the command, Siri will immediately display the newly created reminder, carrying the icon of the app where you'll want to go back to.

The way Apple has implemented this feature is clever, and it shows quite a bit of foresight on their part. Smart reminders via Siri use [Handoff](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681), introduced in iOS 8, to capture app state through the [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUserActivity_Class/) API: the same technology employed to continue an activity from one device onto another can now be used to save that activity as a reminder that contains a deep link to an app.

Developers that started supporting Handoff last year have already done most of the work required to expose their apps to Reminders via Siri: the app icon and relevant section are fetched by NSUserActivity; optionally, developers can add a title to any activity available to the API. The title will become a todo's name in Reminders if the activity is captured via Siri.

![A note opened from Reminders.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151007.jpeg)

> _A note opened from Reminders._

The beauty of this system is that iOS 9 makes virtually any app interaction a potential source for Reminders. Any app view can (theoretically) be an indexable user activity. The latest message in an iMessage conversation can be saved as a reminder. A user profile in Twitterrific is an activity you can save. A point of interest in Maps is something you can be reminded about. An article from Pocket or Instapaper is a view that Siri understands because it's a user activity. The list goes on and on, and developers don't have to adopt any new technology to restructure their apps around this concept. As long as they use Handoff and set the right properties, apps can give Siri a way to create reminders off of them.

As a user, it's nice to be able to open Siri, create a reminder for anything I'm doing in an app, and rest assured that it'll be easy to get back to it later. In the Reminders app, todos created this way display an app icon on the right, which can be tapped to reopen the app in the view you asked to be reminded about. Similarly, if a smart reminder has a due date, its alert will have a button to launch the app with one tap.

![Sometimes, Siri can't remind you about apps.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-150552.jpeg)

> _Sometimes, Siri can't remind you about apps._

Smart reminders won't work everywhere[7](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/), but they're as close to being a universal glue between Reminders and apps as they can possibly be. I don't use Reminders as my primary task management system (I like [Todoist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-task-manager/id572688855?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), and I've been experimenting with [2Do](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) lately), but I recognize the utility of capturing the context of my activity for a task.

Treating app views as points of interest that can become todos and restored at any time is a powerful idea, unavailable to other todo apps on iOS. It facilitates a new type of interaction: rather than saving some generic text as a task, you'll be saving a reminder that takes you back to the rich experience of an app.

I have two problems with smart reminders in iOS 9. The first one is that you can only create them with Siri: if you find yourself in a situation where you can't talk to Siri but still want to create a smart reminder, you can't. It's an odd omission, especially given the new Reminders share extension available to any app that wants to use it.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151102.jpeg)

The new extension can create normal reminders with the same details screen (for dates, location, etc.) of the Reminders app, with no concept of captured user activities and deep links whatsoever. Creating new reminders from Safari through the extension does put a Safari icon in the reminder, but it's an exception.

This leads me to my second problem. The deeper Safari integration of the Reminders extension and a lack of public APIs for smart reminders suggest that the feature is exclusive to Apple's app.

![Smart reminders in Reminders \(left\) and Fantastical, without deep link metadata.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151155.jpeg)

> _Smart reminders in Reminders (left) and Fantastical, without deep link metadata._

Developers of Calendar and Reminders clients such as [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) or [Sunrise](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-outlook-app/id599114150?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) won't be able to read the deep link information (app icon and linked activity) stored in smart reminders; instead, they'll display them as text-only items. There might be workarounds[8](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/), but they're not official solutions - which makes the entire system a little less useful if want to use the Reminders backend without the Reminders app.

The other addition to Reminders in iOS 9 is the ability to create reminders for when you're getting in or out of your car. These reminders use a Bluetooth connection in your car to determine when your device has entered or left the vehicle, which can be useful to remember to do something before driving or immediately after stopping. To this day, Apple hasn't clarified whether car reminders in iOS 9 require [CarPlay](http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) or can work with generic car Bluetooth and third-party accessories.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151314.jpeg)

In my tests and informal polls on Twitter, iOS 9 car reminders didn't work with Bluetooth dongles used to add Bluetooth support in a car (such as my [Aukey one](http://www.amazon.com/Aukey-Bluetooth-Hands-free-Adjustment-BR-C3/dp/B00RJQ35UA)), but they work with built-in Bluetooth configurations (by the car manufacturer) as well as CarPlay ones (of course).

I wasn't able to test this feature, but I'm intrigued by the idea of Reminders getting more savvy about user context and location. I wouldn't be surprised to see HomeKit devices, iBeacons, and Apple Watches from friends nearby becoming future "reminder points" for the app.

Reminders continues to be a basic todo app that works for a lot of people but that falls short of advanced options for users like me. That's okay: Apple doesn't need to provide a full-fledged task manager for the majority of iOS users. The idea of turning app activities into reminders is interesting, and I guess that it'll become a fixture of many people's habits going forward. It hasn't been enough to lure me back into Reminders, but, between Siri reminders and car alerts, its smart simplicity is starting to look a lot more attractive.

## iCloud Drive

For years, certain circles of tech observers argued that Apple should have added a visible filesystem on iOS to make it more like OS X. And for years, Apple went in the opposite direction, doubling down on sandboxing and secure communications between apps.

Last year, we saw the culmination of those efforts with [document provider extensions](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/ios-8-document-providers-and-dropbox/) and a revamped document picker that enabled users to pick (via an extension) any app as a storage service. Even so, don't be fooled by the new iCloud Drive app in iOS 9: this is not Apple relenting and bringing a Finder to iOS. It's an app with a document provider extension - and even a mediocre one.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-153011.jpeg)

The iCloud Drive app in iOS 9 is a wrapper for the iCloud Drive documents that users have been able to view in the iOS document picker since last year. There is nothing new or surprising about it: it's the same interface you know from iOS 8 document pickers and OS X, with app folders, various sorting options, and buttons to create folders and move files around. The app is installed by going to Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Show on Home Screen, but in testing I also received a prompt to install it as soon as I made a modification to a file on my Mac and the change propagated to iOS.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-152626.jpeg)

I guess the reason the app exists is to give people a simple way to view and manage iCloud Drive documents - and that's good, given Apple's baffling decision not to offer an iCloud Drive app _last year_. But everything else in the app is mostly unsurprising, confusing, or frustrating.

![iCloud Drive versions in MindNode.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-203713.jpeg)

> _iCloud Drive versions in MindNode._

The app is extremely basic: it doesn't let you search from the root view into subfolders, there's no way to view and restore versions of files[9](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/) (or recover deleted files, for which [you'll need the iCloud website](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/08/recovering-contacts-calendars-and-reminders-via-icloud/)), and you can view tags, but you can't create them because they're still exclusive to OS X.

To my knowledge - and I've looked around - there is no way to add photos from the Photos app to iCloud Drive. If you take a screenshot and want to organize it in a folder outside of Photos, I don't know how you would do it. This stems from the fact that there is no system-wide iCloud Drive extension to save files from anywhere. Well, there _is_ one, but it's only available for _some_ types of attachments in Mail, and you can't use it anywhere else.

In iOS 9, document-based apps can support a new `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` property that adds the ability to open files from other apps "in place" to edit them without creating a copy. For the iCloud Drive app, this means that documents from iCloud-enabled apps can be tapped in iCloud Drive and they'll automatically open in the associated app without generating a duplicate file.

I ran some tests with an iOS 9 version of [MindNode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-delightful-mind-mapping/id312220102?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), a popular mind-mapping app for iPhone and iPad. When tapped in iCloud Drive, MindNode documents opened the MindNode app in-place, taking me straight to editing. This can also be done by long-pressing a file and tapping the 'Info' button to open a file in an associated app.

![From iCloud Drive to editing in MindNode. Will this work with other apps?](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-204003.jpeg)

> _From iCloud Drive to editing in MindNode. Will this work with other apps?_

However, soon after installing MindNode, iCloud Drive started automatically opening Numbers files into MindNode. My understanding is that, given the lack of an iOS 9 version of Numbers, iCloud Drive sent Numbers documents to an app that supported the file format and the open-in-place feature. What's going to happen once multiple apps support open-in-place and the same file type? Will iCloud Drive display a prompt to pick an app for each file? I had no way to test this.

Ideally, this is a good user experience. The iCloud Drive app is a container of files that lets users jump to editing documents in other apps, avoiding copies and confusion with duplicates. Will the system work once (and if) more developers adopt the open-in-place functionality? It's a good addition, but it's too early to tell.

![Can you guess what this means?](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-153848.jpeg)

> _Can you guess what this means?_

The user experience of document provider extensions is still problematic, with too many steps required to install and navigate external services and a confusing mix of modes for copying and opening files. In addition to open-in-place, another change in this area of iOS is a new label for document providers that don't let other apps open and edit their documents (such as Dropbox and Google Drive). I'm not sure, though, that users will understand what this means, and, like open-in-place, I haven't been able to properly test this functionality with different apps.

The iCloud Drive app joins a complicated array of features, and it does little to improve iOS file management workflows except being an icon on the Home screen and supporting new search APIs in iOS 9.

Apple has a lot of work to do with iCloud Drive on iOS - for both the app and the extension. iOS 9's iCloud Drive doesn't offer the same document management and search features of the Finder of OS X or the clarity and reliability of competing services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. I know I'm not going to put critical work documents - such as this review - in iCloud Drive any time soon. The tools it offers aren't enough to make me feel safe about it.

Don't believe anyone who says the iCloud Drive app for iOS 9 marks the arrival of proper file management on iOS: the road ahead is long and winding.

## Podcasts

Since moving past [tape reels and realistic buttons](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/podcasts-impressione/) in [2013](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-updates-podcasts-find-my-iphone-and-itunes-movie-trailers-for-ios-7/), Apple's Podcasts app has received a variety of incremental [updates](http://www.macstories.net/news/podcasts-for-ios-updated-with-siri-integration-improved-show-notes-support-and-more/) that have made it a decent solution for people who are not seeking the advanced options of third-party clients such as [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) and [Pocket Casts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline). Apple's work on Podcasts culminated in September 2014 with the app being [pre-installed on iOS 8](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/06/17/ios-8-beta-2-tidbits/), further cementing it as the default option for millions of people looking for a way to listen to their favorite shows. Apple's Podcasts didn't destroy the market for third-party alternatives - many of which [are still thriving](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/07/20/podcasts-iphone) - but it brought a good-enough solution for everyone.

With iOS 9, Apple seems to acknowledge that the renaissance of podcasting has to be sustained by a more capable listening experience, and they're enhancing the Podcasts app with welcome improvements on both the iPhone and iPad, particularly for viewing new episodes and controlling playback.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151729.jpeg)

The main addition to the app is a Music-inspired mini player that is available at the bottom of the screen and that can be used to pause and play episodes, see what's playing, and access options without going into the full-screen Now Playing view. The mini player has worked well for iOS 8.4's Music app in that it provides a convenient shortcut for playback controls; on big iPhones, it's easier to reach the mini player than stretching your thumb to tap a Now Playing button at the top.

The mini player works well for Podcasts, too: it can be tapped or dragged to reveal a modal Now Playing view, which, just like Music, comes with a semi-translucent bottom half and a tappable artwork in the upper part that contains episode descriptions and show notes (what would be lyrics in Music). Like Music, Podcasts for iOS 9 offers queue management with Up Next/Play Next to build a list of episodes that can be controlled separately.

The sleep timer has been moved to center of the Now Playing screen, sitting between a share icon and a contextual menu to save an episode or remove it from downloads, view its description, and share it.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151633.jpeg)

Unfortunately, Podcasts also borrows the bad parts of Music's Now Playing view: there are two ways to share an episode's link (with an obnoxious "Check out this cool episode" prepended message), the progress bar is too thin to be dragged comfortably on smaller screens, and the view doesn't take advantage of the iPad's big screen. Episode descriptions aren't displayed next to an episode's artwork or below it on the iPad, so you'll still be tapping a large artwork in the middle of the display to show a small box containing text and links - not exactly a good use of the device.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-152011.jpeg)

Music-based changes aside, the second major addition to Podcasts is in the show organization department with a cleanup of the My Podcasts and My Stations views. In iOS 9, Apple has removed the ability to show all podcasts in a grid view and it has rolled stations into My Podcasts. List view will be the only option in the app now, and any station will be available at the top of the list with a play button to start listening. You can still tap a station to view episodes inside it and tweak settings, which offer the same options of iOS 8.

With stations becoming part of My Podcasts, Apple freed up a slot in the app's tab bar, which is now used by an Unplayed view that is my favorite change in this release. Like other podcast clients before, Podcasts defaults to showing a reverse chronological list (newest to oldest) of all episodes from all podcasts, grouped by day, regardless of their download status.

![Supertop's Castro \(left\) and Podcasts on iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-12-151816.jpeg)

> _Supertop's Castro (left) and Podcasts on iOS 9._

Heavily inspired by Supertop's [Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-app/id723142770?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), the Unplayed view of iOS 9 provides an easy way to view what's new and Unplayed without dabbling in stations and search. As a result, finding episodes to play is faster and their presentation is better as they indicate what's already been downloaded with an icon.

A nice touch of this view is that, as you keep scrolling into past episodes, they will be grouped by extended periods of time such as This Month, Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, and This Year instead of standalone weeks and days. Also, I like how you can search for text in descriptions - a great option for those who often remember specific episodes by links mentioned in it.

To cap it all off, Apple has refreshed individual show pages with more options as well. When a podcast has downloaded episodes on the device, a Saved tab will sit next to Unplayed and Feed to group all episodes stored locally. Podcast and storage settings can be accessed with a new gear icon, and you can choose to remain subscribed to a podcast without receiving notifications of new episodes from it.

[I love Marco Arment's Overcast](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/overcast-review/), and I find its many thoughtful details and listening features unparalleled in any podcast app for iOS. After using Podcasts extensively, though, I admit that I'm liking the mix of simplicity and moderately advanced options it has. The Unplayed view is a terrific addition, and the Music-inspired design and interactions create a cohesive audio experience on iOS 9 that make the two apps feel as part of the same ecosystem. Even when searching on the iTunes Store, iOS 9's Podcasts displays a new tab to get individual podcast episodes, which is fairly similar to Apple Music in that you can start streaming or download right there from search.

I've been listening to my favorite shows with the Podcasts app since June, and I'm fine, but I'll probably go back to Overcast because of its audio effects and upcoming features. The temptation to keep using Podcasts and its system integrations - like Siri, or controls on Apple Watch - is strong, and I can safely recommend the app to anyone looking for a default podcast client. Apple's work on Podcasts for iOS 9 is solid, and the app is a good option for everyone at this point.

## Mail

Mail updates in iOS 9 are far from [what I wished for](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-wishes/), but there are two changes worth mentioning.

![Saving an attachment from Mail in iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-045148.jpeg)

> _Saving an attachment from Mail in iOS 9._

You can now add attachments to new messages from any document provider extension on your device, including iCloud Drive. To do so, you need to tap & hold in the message body to show the copy & paste menu and choose the new 'Add Attachment' option.[10](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/) This will show the document picker to select files from installed apps such as Dropbox and Google Drive, which will be inserted as inline attachments in a message.[11](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/) It's another example of the idea that, in lieu of a traditional filesystem, extendible apps _are_ the modern filesystem of iOS.

The second addition is Markup, a feature borrowed from OS X that brings the power of Preview annotations to iOS. Available for PDF files and images and exclusive to Mail, Markup lets you annotate a file when sending a message or reply with Markup to a file sent by someone else. To annotate a file, you can select it or place the cursor next to it and choose Markup from the copy & paste menu; for replies, you can use an action extension or hit the toolbox icon in the lower right corner of a Quick Look preview in Mail.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-045649.jpeg)

Markup works like the eponymous feature introduced in Yosemite last year: you can add text and shapes, choose between various colors and stroke sizes, add a magnification loupe with adjustable size and zoom, and add a signature. Two nice details that I appreciate: iOS detects freehand shapes and it offers to replace them with a precise version; and, multiple signatures can be added to Markup and they'll be previewed in a menu so you can choose one. Markup signatures will also be synced with iCloud across devices.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-045728.jpeg)

Markup on iOS 9 is good and it works well for annotating images and documents, pointing out ideas and issues to someone over email. The feature has been built with collaboration in mind: annotations won't be flattened onto the document after sending it, so you'll be able to remove Markup annotations from another person, add your own, and send the document back with your notes.

The only problem of Markup, in fact, is that it's too good to be limited to Mail. Apple needs to make Markup compatible with Photos, and even better it should be an option of native Quick Look previews or an action extension for system-wide annotations. I wish I could use Markup anywhere, but I can't.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-045816.jpeg)

In terms of minor enhancements, Mail's swipe gestures have received new icons to more easily distinguish actions. In-app search has been slightly updated as well, with new search tokens that can be tapped to reveal additional filters. There's also a progress bar that indicates when search is loading (unfortunately, it's still slow for Gmail accounts).

![Tap search tokens to reveal options.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-045850.jpeg)

> _Tap search tokens to reveal options._

Mail is a fine default client, affected by the same problems I've been covering for the past two years. Search inside the app is slow, there's no way to [make messages actionable with extensions](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-email-and-extensions/), and the inbox lacks the smart organizational tools found in popular third-party clients such as [Outlook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), [Spark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-smart-email-app-for/id997102246?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), [Inbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inbox-by-gmail-new-email-app/id905060486?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), and [CloudMagic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloudmagic-email/id721677994?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline).

Mail for iOS is a desktop-class app, but that's starting to become a liability. I'm hoping to see more iOS-first features next year.

## Apple News

Apple News, the company's vision for the future of Newsstand mixed with a response to [Flipboard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard-your-social-news/id358801284?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) and [Instant Articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com/), is launching this week in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. While I was able to try the service in Italy by changing my device's region format to American, that's proven to be utterly inconvenient[12](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/7/), and I've chosen to leave the job of reviewing Apple News to my Australian colleague Graham Spencer. I still have a brief thought on the app, though.

![An example of the content I am recommended in Apple News.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050249.jpeg)

> _An example of the content I am recommended in Apple News._

Apple News lets you follow individual sources (websites) and topics; the latter is reminiscent of Zite ([acquired by Flipboard](http://www.macstories.net/news/flipboard-acquires-personalized-magazine-zite/)). Supposedly, the app learns from your reading habits by monitoring what you read on-device, but it also syncs your data via iCloud for convenience. Thanks to machine learning, Apple News should, in theory, understand what an article is about, leading to further exploration of topics via tags, and it should also give you more articles to read in a Music-inspired For You section. The majority of websites in News work by sharing an RSS feed with the service (like MacStories does), which is reformatted to look nice in the app; others are composing special articles for Apple News with [a native format](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/News_Publishing_Guide/FAQ.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015407-CH15-SW5) that offers more control and customization.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050145.jpeg)

> _"Discover Card"?_

In my experience, Apple News has been comically bad at recognizing topics from articles and it has provided me with recommendations that rarely piqued my interest. At one point I thought it was getting better, but that was just the luck of two interesting articles that appeared in For You. Unlike Apple Music, you can only like stories in Apple News with no way to say "I don't like this", and that's proven to be a major issue for me. I can easily ignore 80% of the content recommended to me in the For You section, but there's no way to tell the app about it.

It's not like I haven't tried to like News or use it every day. I have added dozens of blogs and topics to my favorites. I have read articles on both the iPhone and iPad, liked them, and shared them with people. I have explored topics and checked out native articles, which are pretty cool (but the examples were limited). In spite of my dedication, Apple News just didn't get any better as a recommendation engine. And if I have to use it as an RSS reader, then I'm just going to keep using [NewsBlur](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/newsblur/id463981119?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), which gives me more control over my sources.

![Ah, yes, interactive media.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050053.jpeg)

> _Ah, yes, interactive media._

I am an RSS power user, but the problems I noticed in Apple News aren't minor annoyances that only people who subscribe to 200 feeds will notice. You can't reorder items in the Favorites view. You cannot teach the app what is good and what's not interesting. You come across awkwardly computer-generated topics such as Central Processing Unit, Mobile App, Interactive Media, and the all-encompassing Business, which is often complemented by a cover photo of an American businessman with a peculiar hair style. The app doesn't use Safari View Controller for viewing articles on the web, which means that Content Blockers aren't supported either.

There may be a market for Apple News, but this first version feels too unfinished, slow, cluttered, and computer-y for me to take it seriously when it comes to my daily news workflow. I suppose you could appreciate Apple News as a way to browse a few favorite sites and topics in a simple, visual fashion, and I continue to be intrigued by the Apple News Format, which I'll experiment with for MacStories. But for now, I'm back to my trusted NewsBlur.

## Notes

Whenever Apple announces new features and improvements for iOS' built-in Messages app, they like to brag about its status of "most used" app on the iPhone and iPad. While that's probably true given the popularity of iMessage and the importance of mobile messaging in our lives, I wouldn't be surprised to see another Apple app as the runner-up in a daily usage chart: Notes.

Everybody takes notes, but the concept of a "note" varies deeply from user to user. A note can be exactly what the name says - a short text annotation jotted down for later - but it can also be intended as a list of things to remember, a collection of products to buy, reference material, and more. The versatility of apps and data types supported by iOS has spurred the creation of an entire ecosystem of note-taking apps that can serve different purposes. There are apps to save notes as text, locations as notes, images as notes, and even create notes you can share with others or automate for yourself. In the age of iOS, a note is more than text.

For all the third-party apps that promise a superior management of notes, though, I'm willing to bet that Apple's pre-installed Notes app takes the crown for the note-taking app used by millions of users on a daily basis. And unsurprisingly so: the Notes app offers basic formatting and note creation functionalities that most people are okay with, and the integration with the system (namely through Siri) and cross-platform availability via iCloud makes it a good-enough choice for the average iOS user. I couldn't use Apple's Notes app for what I needed to do in the past year with MacStories and Relay FM, but I understood why most of my friends were perfectly content with it. In spite of its awkwardly retro interface, Notes is dependable.

With iOS 9, Apple has taken aim at note-taking apps that allow users to expand notes beyond text and is supercharging its Notes app with brand new features that make it a serious player in the game and a better option for all users. While it was Messages' turn to [receive an overhaul with iOS 8](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/ios-8-messages-our-review/), Notes is getting much deserved attention this year, with some surprising and unexpected results. I've switched to Notes full-time since the first beta of iOS 9, and I don't see myself having to use another note-taking app any time soon.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050704.jpeg)

The first visible change in the new Notes app is the ability to organize notes in folders[13](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/) and, like the Photos app, access recently deleted notes for 30 days with an option to restore them.

The organizational revamp is made possible by Apple migrating from the old, IMAP-based backend of Notes (which relied on an email protocol to sync notes across devices) to a modern, faster [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CloudKit/Reference/CloudKit_Framework_Reference/)-enabled infrastructure that gives the company more control and flexibility.

While it's still possible to sync Notes with an email account configured in the iOS Settings, the ability to organize notes in folders is only exposed to users who set up Notes in local mode (no sync) or iCloud. It's safe to assume the latter will turn out to be the most popular option: once migrated to the new Notes app, iCloud accounts will be able to create folders and keep them in sync between devices - which is obviously not available with local mode.

The possibility to create folders for notes is hinted in the main screen of the app: named 'Folders' and featuring a 'New Folder' button at the bottom of the account list, this is where you'll be able to create a new folder, give it a title, rename it, and delete it when it's no longer needed. In the Folders page, accounts are grouped by name and they list each folder contained inside them. In this review, I'm going to use iCloud as the main example as it's what I've been using for the past three months and what I believe the majority of iOS users will upgrade to after iOS 9.

iCloud puts every note in the 'Notes' folder - the default destination for new notes created via Siri (this can't be changed as there's no setting for a different default folder) and a top-level folder that can't be deleted. Notes can be moved across folders by swiping on an individual note and revealing a Move menu. The interface for this is simple enough and gets the job done, but it lacks the polish of Mail's swipe menu.

From an organizational perspective, folders in Notes are likely to serve most users sufficiently well. I've created folders for Home and MacStories, and I found myself being okay with the ability to have notes in distinct places and access them with one tap from the main screen of the app. For the average iOS user who relies on Notes for short bits of text, folders will be a small revolution - and yet another case of iOS users deriving the greatest joy from the simplest features adopted from OS X.

This doesn't change the fact that folders in Notes will be too limiting for advanced users who are accustomed to deeper management in alternative note-taking apps. Most notably, Notes' search feature (available by swiping down on a folder to reveal a search bar) can't restrict search to a single folder, and even when looking for a string of text that belongs to a note in a folder, the app will simply match that text as part of the top-level 'Notes' folder.

Perhaps more perplexingly, Notes' search always looks for every note across every folder and every account. Typing into the search bar of the general All iCloud "folder" (a filter that is created by default and that collects all notes from all folders in iCloud) has the same effect of trying to search in a folder that only contains a subset of notes.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050751.jpeg)

While I understand why Apple may not want to put advanced search options in the search bar, starting a new search from inside a folder should _at least_ attempt to limit the scope to that folder. The ability to view recent searches and limit search to the current account somewhat helps in retrieving specific notes more quickly, but the aforementioned misreporting of the source folder in search only adds insult to the injury for users who are going to keep several dozens of notes. This is only one of the many issues with Notes for users who would like to do more with the app.

In the grand scheme of things, where you can move notes is, after all, one of the less significant changes in the Notes app. Apple has put great emphasis on what you can _do_ with Notes in iOS 9, and that's where the update feels most impressive - in some cases, even when compared to third-party alternatives.

A note in iOS 9 can contain images, lists and checklists, sketches, link snippets, files, and more. The new Notes app wants to be more than a single-purpose container of text - it aims to become an everything bucket for the iOS user who doesn't want to forget anything. This is accomplished with a refreshed set of controls and system integrations, with a few missteps along the way but, overall, with a new direction for the app that feels like the right move at the right time.

### Formatting

Since version 5.0, iOS has provided system-wide formatting controls for text in the copy & paste menu to make text bold, italic, or underlined in any app that supported rich text, including Mail and Notes. In iOS 9, Apple is taking a page from its iWork suite (specifically, Pages - no pun intended) to offer a brand new formatting view on the iPhone and iPad that considerably extends the text style options available in Notes.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-050837.jpeg)

On the iPhone, new formatting controls are revealed by tapping a "+" button above the keyboard that turns into a special row with a cute animation reminiscent of Dashboard's +/x transition of yore.[14](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/) This bar contains additional controls for checklists, photos, and sketches (more on this in a bit); on the iPad, it's integrated as part of the new Shortcut Bar that features customizable shortcuts on both sides of the keyboard's QuickType bar. On both devices, the Formatting view is accessed by tapping the "Aa" button next to checklists.

Formatting options in Notes include Title, Heading, Body, three types of lists (bulleted, dashed, and numbered, which can be indented), plus shortcuts for bold, italic, and underlined text. On the iPhone, these controls are displayed in the lower half of the screen like Pages, with a scrollable list of styles and visible shortcuts for bold, italic, and underlined. While it's fairly apparent that Apple modeled this screen after Pages and the old Google Docs app, there are some key differences.

![Formatting controls in Pages and Notes.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051348.jpeg)

> _Formatting controls in Pages and Notes._

First, Notes doesn't have the same wealth of controls available in Pages and Docs - Apple doesn't believe users should be able to tweak the font size of body text or the line spacing in Notes, which is meant to be a one-size-fits-all note-taking app for quick interactions and no concept of custom layout whatsoever. Secondly, Apple seems to have learned from its mistakes and put the formatting button towards the bottom of the UI (just above the keyboard) instead of opting for the title bar as they did with Pages. It's clear that Notes has been rethought for the age of big screens, while Pages shows the last vestiges of a pre-iPhone 6 era. The result is that accessing formatting controls in Notes on an iPhone 6 Plus is easier than trying to do the same in Pages.

On the iPad, formatting controls are displayed with a popover floating on top of the Shortcut Bar.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051429.jpeg)

While bold, italic, and underline still require text selection to change the appearance of a text string, making some text a heading or a list can be done by tapping next to it and picking an option in the formatting list without selecting it first. In the months I've spent using Notes for research and personal notes, this has dramatically sped up the process of going from a list of plain text lines to a nicely formatted note with a clear structure. In the new Notes, I can start typing to get thoughts out of my head, then open formatting, tap to place the cursor next to lines I want to make different, and tap away on titles, headings, and lists to make something more relevant or structured.

Notes may not have all the formatting options of Pages, but that's the point. By not being too complex, Notes can appeal to users who don't want or need Pages but that would also like the ability to mark up notes easily.

### Checklists

Something I've always noticed when taking a look at how people I know in real life use iOS is that a vast portion of them uses the Notes app as a todo system. In spite of iOS having its own Reminders app with support for alerts and geofences, a lot of people jot down things they have to do or remember in Notes. With iOS 9, Apple is catering to this use case with the ability to create checklists.

The implementation of checklists is straightforward: a new button next to formatting controls allows you to start a checklist or convert selected lines of text into one. As you're adding items to a checklist, Notes offers automatic list continuation and it can also convert other types of lists into a checklist. You can check off items in a checklist, which gives you an indication of things that have been completed.

![This list may or may not be real.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051528.jpeg)

> _This list may or may not be real._

The way Notes treats checklists isn't similar to how any todo app would work with lists and tasks. There's no concept of dates or reminders in Notes. It's not a smart database that remembers completed items when you convert back and forth between formats and styles. Checklists are just another formatting option in Notes with a stronger visual cue that makes text lines look like a todo list even if, after all, it's just text with a checkbox.

The key difference to keep in mind is that Apple isn't seeking to replace Reminders with Notes in iOS 9. Checklists in Notes can't be given dates or any type of task-related metadata - if you want to organize your todos in proper lists with alerts and sharing settings, you'll still need Reminders.

That is precisely why I believe checklists are such a clever, cunning idea. Apple may not be looking to replace Reminders _directly_, but a lot of people are going to be ecstatic about the addition of checklists in Notes. Those people already use the app to save things they need to act on, but until iOS 9 they've saved them as lines of text that later needed to be manually selected and deleted. This may sound absurd to tech-inclined folks (myself included) who often use multiple dedicated reminder and task management apps, but the reality is that millions of people don't need the overhead of our systems.

I'd be willing to bet that a lot of folks don't want or have to attach metadata like priorities, locations, dates, and notes to tasks; they just want to type them out and get to them eventually. What better system than an app where there are no strict format requirements and where a note can be an image, a list of rich text, a drawing, or an interactive checklist?

For those people, I'd argue that the richness of Notes in iOS 9 will be superior to Reminders, with checklists being the epitome of Apple adjusting to unexpected use cases and the way people use their apps. By definition, something that needs to get done should be saved in Reminders, even without a date. But if millions of customers prefer to mix and match notes with text that loosely represents a todo and if that system can scale to incorporate nicer formatting for todos alongside other media, then it's only fair to make Notes more versatile and yet easier to use than Reminders.

### Images and Sketches

Notes' improved text abilities are complemented by a set of image and video-related features aimed at letting users capture more types of information.

Photos and videos can be interspersed between text and lists in Notes for iOS 9: at any point during editing, you can tap the camera button to choose an item from your photo library or take a new photo or video. Whatever you pick will be displayed inline between text and other media in a note, so you can tap on a video to play it back inside Notes or tap an image to view it in full-screen.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051619.jpeg)

Notes is smart enough to reformat text when an image is inserted (for instance, a checklist is discontinued if you insert an image after some text) and you can also paste images copied from other apps - thus making Notes an ideal companion for Safari when you want to reference images from the web without saving them to Photos.

To keep things simple, Notes doesn't have any sort of image resizing or text reflowing options to build more complex layouts as you can in Pages and other word processors. Again, Apple's goal is to offer a more powerful note-taking app and not necessarily a slimmer Pages, so this makes sense to me. I didn't miss such options in my tests, and I like that I can't go wrong by inserting a bunch of pictures alongside text in a note.

![Messages' photo picker \(right\) is a superior implementation.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051705.jpeg)

> _Messages' photo picker (right) is a superior implementation._

Alas, the image picker itself leaves a lot to be desired: rather than adopting the useful picker found in Messages (which displays recent media in a swipeable tray), Notes comes with a dull menu to open a picker or take a new picture.

More interestingly, Apple has built a sketching mode into Notes, enabling users to mix text, media, and other content with interactive sketches that can be updated at any time and exported as images.

Sketching is accessed by tapping the drawing icon in the bottom toolbar, which will kick Notes into a drawing screen that offers a pen, a sharpie, a pencil, a ruler, an eraser, and a color picker. A drawing's background defaults to the same paper texture used throughout the app, and pages can be flipped horizontally or vertically. Sketches can be shared with other apps by tapping the share icon in the top right, which will export a static image.

When playing around with sketches in Notes, you'll likely notice two things: the limited tools available when compared to standalone apps like [Paper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree-draw-sketch/id506003812?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline), and the solid performance of drawing on screen in Apple's app.

Simplicity shouldn't come as a surprise: the entire app hinges on the idea of enriching a traditional note-taking environment with _just enough more stuff_, and, overall, Apple is doing a pretty good job at covering the basics. Performance, though, is a whole other topic.

In any form of interactive video output, latency is an issue to consider. Whether it's controlling videogames with buttons or touching an iPad's screen to tap something, the relationship between humans and software depends on latency - the delay in how long it takes for input to translate to output. And because our fingers are better input methods than we tend to believe, even the slightest amount of higher latency can lead to a disruptive user experience when the human eye is able to discern a visible delay.

Ever swiped quickly on a multitouch display and noticed virtual ink struggling to catch up with your finger sliding across the screen? That's latency.[15](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/)

Visual latency can be ascribed to various factors, but most notably in modern software, CPUs are to blame for the delay we observe between our actions and the expected result. With iOS 9, Apple has set out to drastically reduce latency to make apps more responsive, cutting down the amount of time required to compute user touches and render them on screen. This initiative - which comes with new APIs for developers - will have the biggest impact on games (which are heavily reliant on fast multitouch gestures) and _drawing apps_ - not to mention the upcoming [Pencil for iPad Pro](https://www.macstories.net/news/ipad-pro-our-complete-overview/).

One of the downsides of drawing apps on iOS (and particularly on iPad) is the noticeable delay between swiping and seeing ink come up on screen. While developers have written [entire custom engines](http://blog.fiftythree.com/posts/the-intention-behind-think-kit) dedicated to making ink appear as naturally as possible, laws of physics and intrinsic iOS limitations have made it nearly impossible to replicate the feeling of a real pen on a multitouch display.

Apple's goal with iOS 9 isn't to make drawing on iOS exactly like using a physical pen, but to get very close to it.

Apple is introducing Touch Coalescing, an API that leverages the iPad Air 2's twice-as-fast 120Hz touch scan update rate to double the number of touches registered by the OS and therefore the touch information exposed to apps. Thanks to the higher touch scan rate of the Air 2 (other iOS devices can scan for touches at 60Hz), iOS 9 can accumulate twice the number of touches per second, but also coalesce those updates without wasting computational work in an app. Coalesced touches enable a single frame on the iPad Air 2 to scan for two touches, which are available to developers on demand via an API.

But that's not all. On top of doubling the number of touches iOS can recognize on each refresh, Apple has built a predictive touch engine that can look into the future of user touches and guess where a user's finger may be going next. Using some highly tuned algorithms, iOS 9 can provide developers with a fresh set of predicted touches all the time, which can be used to further decrease latency as they're added to the iOS graphics pipeline, preceding the work needed to scan for touches, animate them, and pass them to an app. Built into UIKit, predicted touches are independent from coalesced touches, but together they can be used to make latency on iOS even lower to get closer to the idea of direct manipulation and fast performance.

By Apple's estimates, the work done on iOS 9 has allowed input recognition to go from four frames to a frame and a half. If the above paragraphs are too technical: this is a massive performance improvement for drawing apps and games on the iPad Air 2, and it bodes well for the iPad Pro and Pencil accessory.

Drawing in Notes for iOS 9 is fast, smooth, and natural. As you swipe across the screen using the pen tool or the pencil, ink renders smoothly (this is the only area where the app's paper texture is justified) and, more importantly, animates quickly and follows the tip of your finger unlike any other drawing app. In testing Notes drawing on my iPad Air 2 and iPhone 6 Plus, I noticed no visible difference between the two, with solid performance on both devices in terms of rendering speed and animations. What Apple has done for advanced touch input in iOS 9 can be noticed when drawing in the Notes app, even if saying "it's fast" doesn't do justice to the fascinating complexity behind it.

As a user, it seems clear that drawing in Notes isn't aimed at artists. Notes doesn't want to replace Paper: rather, sketches are used as complements to text and images, useful in those occasions where the human finger can express shapes and ideas that would take too long with apps and images.

The ruler is an obvious candidate for education and for whoever is seeking to use an iPad to plan future house redecorations: once placed on the screen, the ruler can be rotated with two fingers to tilt its angle, then you can pick a tool and swipe across it to draw a straight, precise line that wouldn't be possible without it. It's an incredibly fun and reliable implementation and one of Apple's finest details in iOS 9.

Sketches in Notes are a good example of why Apple likes to control the entire stack. If the company wasn't in charge of every single aspect of its hardware and software, it wouldn't have been able to optimize iOS to take advantage of the display of the iPad Air 2 and build a predictive touch engine aimed at reducing latency.

When you control every facet of the experience, you can focus on seemingly unimportant aspects of software such as going from four frames to one and a half for input recognition, even if most users only want to produce crummy drawings in Notes. And that's okay, because knowing how that works and why it performs so well is part of the fun in these articles, and I'm excited to see what developers do with it.

### Share Extension and Links

Apple's willingness to turn Notes into iOS' everything bucket is perhaps best exemplified by its new share extension. From anywhere on iOS, you can now capture text, links, and files and save them into a new note or, even better, append them to an existing note. This is, alongside iPad multitasking, one of my favorite features of iOS 9 and it has allowed me to drop several workflows I built for iOS 8.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051846.jpeg)

iOS 9's Notes extension lives in the share sheet, and it's a share extension that lets you capture anything you come across that can be shared by an app. The extension is a floating popup that carries the same paper texture of the Notes app, with the same yellow UI accents and letterpress effect on text. The Notes extension defaults to saving shared items in a new note, but you can tap the "Choose Note" button at the bottom to pick an existing note where you'd like to save something into. The extension will also remember the last note you saved an item into if you bring it up after a few seconds.

If you've used extensions such as [Evernote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline)'s or 2Do's since their debut last year, you'll be familiar with the thinking behind the Notes extension. Any text, URL, or file you can share on iOS through the native share sheet can be passed to the Notes extension, which will preview it inline whenever possible. If you're sending text to the extension, it will prefill the Notes sheet; an image will get a thumbnail preview on the right; a web link will get a nice snippet preview with a title and the first image found on the webpage.

There are two ways the Notes extension will attempt to save content in a note. For data that can be rendered inline such as videos, images, and text, the extension will either show an editable text field (text can always be edited manually upon saving through the extension) or a thumbnail preview. You can try this out by saving a photo or a video from Photos, or some text selected from Mail via the new Share button in the copy & paste menu: both media and text will be tappable or editable in a note - as if you created them from Notes in the first place.

Alternatively, Notes will save links or files it can't render inline as small units of content that appear as standalone, tappable items in between body text. In some cases, tapping these note attachments will show a Quick Look preview, or it'll open Safari, or - and this is where the extension and the app get more creative - it'll adjust the UI to preview the attached content with native media controls.

Let's start with web links. For me, saving links from apps like Twitter clients or news readers accounts to one of the activities I perform the most on a daily basis on my devices. I save links because I want to cover them on MacStories, or because I need to share them with someone, or perhaps they're reference material I'll have to find again in the future. The apps I use to manage this daily avalanche of links tend to treat them for what they are: hyperlinks that open Safari. This is the case for apps like 2Do, Messages, Mail, NewsBlur, and countless others. The richness of the web doesn't apply to its resource locator, which is just a link.

Notes' extension doesn't work like that. In the new app, Apple has devised a way to offer a basic preview of the information available at the source URL with rich link snippets that display the associated webpage's title, description, and lead image. Web link previews in Notes are further proof of Apple's commitment to web metadata technologies such as Open Graph[16](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/), and they provide a fantastic way to give meaning to a URL.

![Hey, Underscore!](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-051953.jpeg)

> _Hey, Underscore!_

When saving a link with the Notes extension from any iOS app capable of sharing URLs (it doesn't have to be Safari), the extension will fetch the link's metadata and display them in the compose sheet. This is a good way to preview URLs without opening a web view: if you're in, say, a Twitter client and want to know what a link is about without giving the website a page view, you can send the link to the Notes extension and it'll fetch the webpage's title and description for you.[17](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/)

The extension's parser is capable of following multiple domain redirects, too: if you give the extension a shortened URL, it won't try to resolve it to its source domain, but it'll still follow all redirects until it can preview the final webpage's information. In my tests, the extension took less than a second to present a link snippet for unfurled links, but it could take a couple of seconds for shortened links with multiple redirects (such as [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) or [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) links).

As far as I know, no other note-taking app on iOS offers a smart web capture feature that can parse a link's metadata to give more context to a link. Apple's implementation could have used an indicator to show when Notes is trying to parse a link's title and thumbnail preview[18](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/8/), but, overall, it's an invisible, it-just-works kind of feature that performs admirably.

I'm in love with the way the Notes extension saves links. As a writer on the web, the link is my currency, but sometimes its value can't be easily assessed because URLs are fundamentally meaningless. With the Notes extension, I can assemble a note with a bunch of links and be presented with a series of small previews that have titles, two-line descriptions, and image thumbnails. And because the Notes extension can create new notes or append content to the bottom of an existing note, I can keep my lists of links as separate notes where web previews are saved in chronological order, without formatting issues, without having to create complex workflows to manage it all.

This seemingly minor addition fixes a serious annoyance of mine. Every week, I collect links in separate lists for this site, our MacStories Weekly newsletter for [Club MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/club/) members, [Connected](http://www.relay.fm/connected), and [Virtual](http://www.relay.fm/virtual). Until a few months ago, I used to go through each list to evaluate the importance of each link, which usually meant reopening it in Safari to recall what it was about. This was a time-consuming process, especially because apps like Evernote would sometimes fail at opening a link in Safari when tapping it.

With Notes, I now keep lists of links in the main Notes folder and going through the list simply involves taking a look at a link preview, then long-tapping to delete or copy. Thanks to the built-in link previews, my workflow has been reduced to a nimble visual reassessment and a tap & hold, which is better than what I used to do to process links.

I didn't think having a preview of a link's title and a thumbnail would do much, but, in practice, the way Notes presents links saved from the extension is a superior solution to other note-taking apps for iOS in every way. I've been spoiled by web link previews in Notes, and now I want them everywhere.

And that's exactly the problem: this new behavior is exclusive to Notes, and specifically to the Notes extension. If you copy a link from, say, Messages (which, like other Apple apps, _still_ doesn't display the system share sheet for tap & hold) and paste it into a note, it won't be expanded to become a rich snippet - it'll be an old fashioned tappable URL. Similarly, while Apple has built a way to better preview URLs by attaching visual metadata to them, this system isn't used across other Apple apps on iOS 9, which are still limited to displaying links as URLs with no extra information.

![There's a clear winner here.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-052101.jpeg)

> _There's a clear winner here._

As services such as Twitter, Slack, and Facebook have shown, there's value in presenting URLs as cards of content that push information from the web to the user. Apple is thinking along these lines with rich snippets in Notes and Spotlight for iOS 9, but while the results are commendable, such effort isn't consistent throughout the OS. I'm hoping iOS 10 will offer new APIs to present URLs as rich snippets like Notes does today.

#### Files

The other benefit of a smarter, more versatile Notes app is a wider array of options for saving attachments into it. Images and videos aside, the Notes extension is capable of accepting any file that can be shared via the share sheet on iOS 9, making it an intriguing solution for folks who have relied on database-style apps such as OneNote and Evernote for similar workflows. I have some reservations on Notes' attachment handling, which ranges from "very good" to "mysteriously half-baked".

![Attaching files to Notes.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-052250.jpeg)

> _Attaching files to Notes._

In theory, you should be able to send any file to the Notes extension and choose whether you want to create a new note for it or append it to an existing one - all while retaining the ability to add a text comment from the share sheet. Files saved to Notes via the share extension will appear as links: units displayed inline within a note, with filename, size, and a thumbnail preview whenever possible. In spite of Notes' rich engine, some file types will be rendered as Quick Look attachments that need to be previewed in a separate modal window. A .txt file won't be attached with text, but you'll get a .txt icon you have to tap to view plain text in Quick Look; PDFs will be previewed in the body of a note, but you'll have to tap them to swipe through pages.

What's even stranger is the inconsistency of the attachment/preview system and fantastic little touches pitted against glaring omissions. You can search for text contained in PDFs saved in Notes, but you can't use Markup from Quick Look previews. iOS has an underlying engine to render rich text consistently between apps, but selecting some formatted text in Mail to share it with the Notes extension will strip all formatting and save it as plain text in the app.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-052348.jpeg)

Then, you come across voice memos, which can be saved into Notes as attachments and that have a Play button that transforms the app's title bar in a media player with playback controls.

![Wait, what?](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-052541.jpeg)

> _Wait, what?_

Wait, what?

I understand why Apple may want to rely on extensions to extend Notes beyond its advertised capabilities. In avoiding buttons to attach voice recordings, documents, and other files from apps, Apple isn't only ensuring the Notes UI isn't too cluttered (unlike Evernote) - they're also reducing the potential cognitive load of having to know what all those buttons do.

This argument doesn't preclude Apple from having some basic consistency for Quick Look previews in Notes or properly teaching users that they can save a variety of file types into the app. How should a college student know that a voice memo can be saved (and played back) inside Notes? Why do PDFs come with different preview features in Mail and Notes?

Apple has done good work with the Notes extension in iOS 9. It's been a fantastic addition to my workflow for saving links and appending content to existing notes. But if Apple truly wants to make Notes a versatile repository for all kinds of user content without an overbearing UI, the extension and Quick Look frameworks need to be reworked to always maintain formatting and have better previews for files inside Notes. Today, you can save files to Notes, but its previews are lacking in several ways.

### Attachments Browser

With Notes taking on new attachment-handling duties, Apple has chosen to give the app an additional view to browse all attachments saved across all folders. Accessed by tapping the grid icon in the bottom left corner of the notes sidebar, the Attachments Browser lets you view a cluster of photos and videos, sketches, websites, audio clips, and documents in a single screen.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-052200.jpeg)

You can tap each item to preview it and go to its associated note, or you can tap & hold it to go to the note directly. The main screen displays the most recent attachments for each category, with a 'See All' button on the right to view the full grid in a separate view.

I have mixed feelings about the Attachments Browser. On one hand, it's the perfect showcase for Notes' attachment abilities as it can cull non-text items from all notes and present them in a view that brings them front and center. On the other hand, that's also its biggest downside: you can't view attachments per folder - you can only view all attachments from all notes. If you're the kind of user who adds a lot of images to notes and would like a way to filter them by folder, you won't be able to do that in this version of Notes.

The Attachments Browser also shares the same limitations of the extension when it comes to file types it doesn't understand: .zip archives saved from other apps will be categorized under 'Documents', for instance. On the other hand, audio clips are playable from the main view of the browser by tapping a large Play button (cool) and links can be opened in Safari with a single tap.

In spite of its shortcomings, the Attachments Browser is a clever addition to Notes. While the entire app relies on blurring the difference between text and non-text content for a seamless experience, the Attachments Browser allows you to filter out everything that isn't text and that you can interact with.

### Notes as Rich Documents

The few issues I have with Notes' search and the extension don't change my overall take on this update. With iOS 9, Notes isn't just a powerful alternative to third-party note-taking apps - it joins Safari on the podium of Apple's best work on iOS, period.

I've been an Evernote user for years. I've often talked about the service's adaptability to rich text and file attachments. I've relied on integrations with external apps through the [Evernote API](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/). I've shared notes and entire notebooks with others. Notes doesn't have any of this. There's no API for third-party apps and services to plug into; no sharing of notes and folders, not even with family members; no sorting options, no tags, no subfolders. From a power user's perspective, Notes is the wrong choice. So why all this enthusiasm?

At some point, consistency and reliability trump automation and feature richness. Should I use something that offers the _potential benefit_ of dozens of features, or am I better served by an app that covers the basics elegantly, works expectedly, but that has very clear limitations for automation and advanced use cases? Do I like the _thought_ of power user features in my notes more than their actual practicality?

After years of Evernote changes, feature additions, and Work Chat prompts, the simplicity of Notes is refreshing. It doesn't cover many aspects of what Evernote is capable of, and many will be perfectly happy to stick with Evernote because they truly need all of its features.

But I don't. In using Notes for iOS 9, I realized that I'm okay with the ability to intermix rich text and images, file attachments and sketches, all while taking advantage of one of the best share extensions on iOS, Siri integration, Spotlight search, and multitasking on iPad. All the workflows I created to append links to a note pale in comparison to the effectiveness of Notes' extension and link previews. Evernote's sync can't be as fast or frequent as Notes' iCloud backend. The bloat that Evernote accumulated through the years has been replaced by a basic yet powerful note-taking app that does everything I need, and I feel relieved knowing I no longer have to fight Evernote's tendency for _more_. This is all there is, and it's okay.

That's not to say Notes can't get better. Besides the aforementioned problems with search, the extension, and file attachments, I miss a way to pin specific notes at the top of my list, or to sort them alphabetically when I want to. Siri can't delete notes, which I don't understand. The entire app is still stuck on a paper texture and letterpress text that makes sense for sketches, but that, like Reminders, no longer has a reason to exist on iOS and that makes text harder to read sometimes.

It's been three months since I started using Notes on iOS 9, and I can't imagine going back to any other app for my needs, which involve rich text, images, links, and documents. As users increasingly rely on iPhones and iPads as their primary (and often only) computers, the decision to turn Notes into a central location for all kinds of content was a good one. Notes on iOS 9 is an extremely intelligent, focused, and useful update.

## iPad

After years of little attention paid to the user interface and features of iOS for iPad, Apple wants to correct its course with iOS 9. A combination of the OS' maturity and willingness to reignite interest in the platform amid [declining sales](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-q3-2015-results-49-6-billion-revenue-47-5-million-iphones-10-9-million-ipads-sold/), Apple's initiative encompasses app interaction, multitasking, text input, and external keyboard integration.

The result is the most important iOS release for iPad to date, as well as a stepping stone for the future of the device as an everyday computer.

### Growing Pains

When the iPad launched in 2010, few in the tech press knew what to make of it. If it's a tablet, why does it run iPhone OS instead of a desktop OS? Is it a big iPod touch or a small Mac?

As it turned out, the preoccupations of tech bloggers were the very factors that contributed to the record-breaking first years of iPad. It was a bigger iOS device that ran familiar software specifically designed to make you feel like you were holding and using a physical object. The iPad could be a book and a newspaper. A calculator on your desk and a portable typewriter. An agenda. A diary. By design, the full-screen nature of apps on the iPad had been engineered to convince you of one simple truth: _This device can be anything_. And because millions already knew how to use it thanks to iPhone OS, it did offer something for everyone.

The biggest problem that has affected the iPad in the past three years stems from Apple itself. After the launch of iOS 6, the company began a long and tortuous journey towards a new identity for iOS. During this period, iPad got the short end of the redesign stick: while Apple was busy rethinking the core structure and visual appareance of the iPhone, the iPad got unimaginative adaptations and other UI leftovers.

Three years after the iPad's launch, Apple didn't seize the opportunity to make iPad features and apps unique and tailored to the platform. They just scaled them up. The same consistency that was a smart move in 2010 didn't make much sense in 2013 after iOS 7 and the chance of a fresh start.

iOS 7 wasn't just a visual disappointment for iPad users who were craving for attention. From a functional standpoint, the iPad had evolved to an appealing computer replacement for many, albeit with too many compromises. Tasks that were trivial on a PC were too difficult, if not downright impossible, on an iPad. iOS apps were unable to communicate with each other. Apple had ushered users in the post-PC era with the original iPad and then left them halfway there.

On the iPad, iOS 7 felt like a rushed conversion that had forgotten about the promise of a revolution.

Big changes, however, often come in small doses. With last year's iOS 8, we caught a glimpse of what Apple's thought process might have been: if iOS 7 laid a new visual foundation, iOS 8 was going to spread a stronger technical layer on top of it. We witnessed how Apple was willing to modularize the concept of app - the long-sacred silo - into multiple functionalities and screen sizes connected by a common, secure thread. iOS 8 came out as the yin to iOS 7's yang: free of their (sometimes forced, frequently derided) photorealistic appearance, apps were granted an out-of-sandbox permission, too.

It's not uncommon to rely on hindsight to understand the iterative changes behind Apple's products. iOS 7 brought a new, subdued look. iOS 8 introduced a framework to extends apps. These are not features designed in a vacuum.

Extensions make more sense with a design language that focuses on color rather than heavy textures and 3D graphics. Imagine if all your apps still looked like distinct objects and you had to interact with panels of leather on top of wooden backgrounds, metal slates, and paper sheets. Similarly, consider the new iPhones and iPads: without a design that eschews pixel-perfect object recreations, many developers would have to target new screen sizes with bitmap graphics that take time away from actual app development.

iOS 7 and iOS 8 were [deeply intertwined](http://www.macstories.net/stories/bitter-medicine/), two sides of the same coin that Apple revealed in the span of a year. In the iPad's case, they still weren't enough to complete the vision of what Apple had in store for the future of the device.

But as they say: third time's the charm.

### The Importance of Being iPad

Apple's big bet on the iPad with iOS 9 involves deep changes in multitasking and productivity enhancements that are both obvious and unexpected. To understand the gravity and consequential paradigm shift of these new features, it's important to observe the iPad's role today and reflect on why Apple is turning its attention to the device now.

The iPad in 2015 is an incredible computer at the top of the line, powered by a more flexible OS that still struggles to accommodate some basic use cases and workflows. This is key to understand the changes Apple is bringing to the iPad this year. Everything new in iOS 9 for iPad ultimately comes down to this idea:

The iPad is a computer in search of its own OS.

As [I noted in my review](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/), the iPad Air 2 is a dramatically faster and more capable iPad than older generations, to the point where it's fair to wonder _why_ such power is needed at all.

In the same product line, though, lies the ever-surviving iPad 2, a second-generation device released in 2011 and that can still run the latest version of iOS. The longevity of iPad hardware and Apple's policy to support old devices with software updates has created a curious dichotomy for the company: the latest iPad, more powerful than traditional computers in some instances; and the iPad 2, still receiving updates but far from the user experience of the Air 2.

The tension between new and old, modern and traditional is also quite apparent in iOS itself. With iOS 8, Apple debuted user features and developer frameworks that allowed an iPad to handle tasks that wouldn't be possible on a Mac. For some people, an iPad running iOS 8 is preferable to a Mac with OS X. This is exactly why I elected the iPad Air 2 as my primary computer: besides form factor advantages, I like iOS and its app ecosystem better.

At the same time, iOS 8 is still behind OS X when it comes to performing tasks that involve switching between apps, working with files, and editing text. These are the tentpoles of any personal computing experience from the past two decades and the functionalities added in iOS 8 have done little - if nothing - to address the concerns expressed by iPad users about them. Action and share extensions have helped in exchanging data between apps, but they're not the solution to look at two things at the same time; custom keyboards have provided [a novel way of input](http://www.macstories.net/ios/sunrise-launches-meet-a-custom-keyboard-to-schedule-meetings/) and data extraction from apps, but what the iPad needs is a faster way to select and edit text.

The problem that Apple needs to solve with iOS 9 for iPad is complex. How can Apple make good of the post-PC promise with features that are drastically different from what came before - without the overhead and inherent complexity of forty years of desktop computers - but also capable of addressing modern user needs and workflows?

Apple's answer comes as a cornucopia of changes, with new Slide Over, Split View, and Picture-in-Picture features for multitasking, better support for external keyboard shortcuts, enhancements to the software keyboard, and even a gesture to navigate and select text using multitouch.

The recurring theme of contrast finds its zenith in the multitasking and productivity additions to the iPad in iOS 9: some of them are brand new ideas previously unseen on OS X; others borrow heavily from the company's desktop OS. Some of them are exclusive to the powerful Air 2; others have made their way to older iPads as well.

Prior to inspection, such peculiar mix begs the question: does Apple know new ways to think about old problems, or is this _too much_ for an iPad to handle?

One thing's for sure: Apple is finally making what the iPad was looking for.

  


### Slide Over

Apple's first big change to iPad multitasking requires a single swipe from the right edge of the screen.[19](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/) Called Slide Over, this is what you'll want to use to view and interact with another app without leaving the app you're in.

> _Safari and Notes in Slide Over._

Slide Over works by putting a secondary app on top of the app you're currently using, called the primary app. It's based on [compact and regular size classes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-IB_adaptive_sizes/chapters/AboutAdaptiveSizeDesign.html), and it works in both portrait and landscape orientations. Slide Over is supported on the following iPad models:

  * iPad mini 2
  * iPad mini 3
  * iPad mini 4
  * iPad Air
  * iPad Air 2
  * iPad Pro

Slide Over can be activated from any app, regardless of whether the app you're using has been updated for iOS 9 or not. The fact that the app you're in may not support Slide Over in iOS 9 doesn't have any influence on the secondary app that you'll be able to invoke. Slide Over is all about the secondary app and cycling through apps that support it.

There are two ways to activate Slide Over with a swipe from the right edge of the screen. You can swipe from the area around the middle of the screen (vertically centered) to open Slide Over directly; or, you can swipe from above or below the center of the screen to reveal a pulling indicator that you can then grab to fully reveal Slide Over.

![The right side of the iPad's screen, showing the Slide Over pulling indicator.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-015833.jpeg)

> _The right side of the iPad's screen, showing the Slide Over pulling indicator._

The pulling indicator is the same that is used for Control Center and Notification Center when the app you're in is running in full-screen mode (a common occurrence for games and other video apps). Slide Over joins Control Center and Notification Center in being a UI layer that is activated by swiping from the edge of the screen and that sits atop any running app.[20](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)

Slide Over also comes with its own app switcher to cycle through apps. Slide Over's app switcher is a dark overlay with app icons contained inside light gray boxes; only apps that support Slide Over will be shown in this view.

![Slide Over's app switcher.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-025129.jpeg)

> _Slide Over's app switcher._

Think of Slide Over as a subset of recently used apps, specifically (and exclusively) those updated for iOS 9 multitasking. You can't quit apps in Slide Over: you can only tap to open an app and make it the secondary app running on top of an app you're already in.

The cleverness of Slide Over lies in how its design dictates the experience of using it. When you pick a secondary app, it opens in what may be described as an iPhone app layout, stretched up vertically to fit the iPad's screen. In both landscape and portrait mode, a secondary app is resized to a compact size class that resembles an iPhone app: in Slide Over, Safari moves the top toolbar buttons to the bottom of the screen like it does on the iPhone; Messages, Mail, and other Apple apps look exactly like their iPhone counterparts, only taller.

> _Pictured above: Calendar, Mail, and Podcasts in Slide Over next to Safari._

To achieve this, iOS 9 uses size classes (a technology that developers have started supporting to make iOS apps responsive for multiple display sizes) to show a UI that's appropriate for a narrow and elongated mode. This makes Slide Over easy to use and familiar (most apps feel _and_ work like iPhone apps) and a great way to interact with another app without taking it full-screen.

Design serves the experience in Slide Over, and it works. If you swipe to reveal Mail in Slide Over, you'll be presented with a familiar view of messages in your inbox, resized to fit the Slide Over panel. If you open Notes, you'll see a list of your notes; if you tap one, Slide Over will move to the subview required to display the note. Mail, Messages, Calendar, and other Apple apps rely on adaptive UIs and compact size classes to split app sidebars and navigation points into layouts that can be displayed in a single column with Slide Over.

To truly appreciate Slide Over, we need to look back at Apple's past iOS SDKs. Since 2012, the company has been advocating for APIs to create apps capable of responding to any screen size, orientation, or localization. With a greater matrix of iOS screen sizes available to customers in more countries, Apple felt it was appropriate to rethink the design and development process with a focus on adaptivity: [Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Introduction/Introduction.html), [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TransitionGuide/AppearanceCustomization.html), and [Size Classes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/LayoutandAppearance.html) were seen as signs of smaller iPads and bigger iPhones back then; today, they provide the context necessary to understand iPad multitasking in iOS 9.

Developers who have been paying attention to Apple's announcements and advice have already done most of the work required to support iPad multitasking: Slide Over uses the same compact size class that developers have grown accustomed to using on the iPhone. It's not just easier to support Slide Over this way: it's the best option when you're dealing with this type of layout.

Slide Over rethinks the idea of looking up information or acting on something without leaving an app. Think of it as having an iPhone next to any app you're using without the inconvenience of juggling multiple devices. Need to look up a word on Google while you're reading a document? Open Safari in Slide Over, search, and return to what you were doing. Want to type out an email without closing Twitter? Slide Over, Mail, compose, send. Same for keeping a conversation going on iMessage, checking your schedule in Calendar, or glancing at how many emails are in your inbox.

Thanks to the iPad's large screen, you no longer need to launch apps to interact with them. A swipe is all it takes to get things done and be more efficient. This is Apple's pitch for Slide Over.

> _Agile Tortoise's Drafts and Terminology._

An important aspect to note about Slide Over is that while a secondary app doesn't take over the primary app visually[21](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/), it does take over functionally. When Slide Over is open, you can't interact with the primary app and the secondary app simultaneously: only the secondary app is active and able to receive touch input, with the primary one being dimmed in the background. A single tap outside the Slide Over area immediately dismisses the secondary app[22](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/). When Slide Over is shown, the software keyboard is exclusive to the secondary app. From a user's perspective, the primary app is inactive underneath Slide Over.

Keyboard input is another interesting decision Apple had to settle on when designing Slide Over. When you tap into a text field that shows the keyboard in a Slide Over app, you'll get the full-screen iPad keyboard, but it'll only work with the secondary app. The layering makes sense - having a smaller, iPhone-sized keyboard just for Slide Over would be terrible on an iPad - but it introduces a new level of visual complexity that poses new challenges for Apple and developers

![Slide Over's app switcher can be activated by swiping down from this indicator \(pictured: Twitterrific\).](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-192105.jpeg)

> _Slide Over's app switcher can be activated by swiping down from this indicator (pictured: Twitterrific)._

Slide Over grants surprising freedom in terms of app switching. Slide Over uses a persistent app switcher indicator that can be dragged to move between the secondary app and the picker for other apps that support Slide Over. The indicator is aligned with the clock in the status bar and it can be swiped to move from app to app switcher. Effectively, this is another status bar indicator: this portion of the screen behaves like a traditional status bar in that you can tap on it to scroll to the top of lists in apps. The similarities end here, as you'll primarily interact with the Slide Over status bar to swipe it and switch between apps.

The animation to move across apps in Slide Over is some of Apple's finest visual work in iOS 9. As you begin to pull down, the secondary app starts shrinking while following your gesture - first by adopting rounded corners, then by fitting the contents of the screen to a smaller box that sits below more app icons that come down from the top of the app switcher. It's a smooth, rewarding animation that is fast and intuitive - exactly the kind of [sloppy and comfortable gesture](http://www.macstories.net/linked/sloppy-swiping/) that can be performed in a second without looking. It feels right, and it doesn't skip a single frame on the iPad Air 2.[23](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)

An inconsistency I'd point out is that some Apple apps haven't been updated with support for Slide Over. I can accept App Store and iTunes not having a compact mode (although it would be welcome), but why doesn't Music support Slide Over? It'd be a good showcase of the feature's _raison d'etre_: swipe to open Music, pick a song, play, and you're back in the primary app. This is an oversight that I'm expecting Apple to rectify soon.

Slide Over is a terrific addition to iPad multitasking. It's easy to activate and it doesn't compromise on the full functionality of a secondary app: when you open it, you're not presented with a lite version of another app - you're given the whole experience, with its full feature set, only in a compact layout.

This is a powerful idea, as it noticeably cuts down the time required to jump between apps on an iPad. It makes the iPad's screen feel like a large canvas of opportunities rather than a wasteland of bright pixels.

Slide Over is so good, I wish notifications could always open in it, and I wish I could have it on my 6 Plus as well. Double-clicking on the Home button feels so passe when you can swipe to peek at apps.

Slide Over is only a sliver of the iPad's multitasking rebirth. What Slide Over _enables_ is an even bigger change for iPad users, and a drastic new approach to app interaction on iOS.

  1. Or the left edge, if you're using iOS 9 with a right-to-left language. In iOS 9, Apple has introduced support for completely mirrored interfaces thanks to enhancements to UIKit; as a result, Slide Over will appear on the left side of the screen for right-to-left languages. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)
  2. The main difference is that Notification/Control Center can be fully revealed with a swipe from anywhere at the top or bottom (not just the center), and they also work on the Home and Lock screens. It's not totally obvious that Slide Over can be activated by swiping just around where the vertical center of the screen may be; this decision makes sense when you consider the potential conflicts with apps that already rely on swipe gestures from the right edge. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)
  3. With one notable exception: the rightmost area of the iOS status bar. Slide Over's own title bar covers the space where iOS displays the battery, Bluetooth, and location icons. I believe this was a deliberate design choice, as it reinforces the idea that Slide Over is meant for temporary, brief interactions to get in and out of apps (because you wouldn't want your status bar to be always covered by something else). [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)
  4. But both Control Center and Notification Center can be opened without dismissing Slide Over. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)
  5. If you want to have a good time, swipe up and down in the Slide Over app switcher to watch app icons grow and shrink again. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/)
  


### Split View

If there was still any doubt on the iPad graduating from utility to computer with iOS 9, Split View clears it all. Split View is a fundamental re-imagination of the iPad's interaction model five years after its launch. More than any other productivity enhancement in iOS 9, Split View is the iPad's coming-of-age feature.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-10-025939.jpeg)

As the name suggests, Split View is Apple's take on split-screen multitasking that lets the iPad display two apps simultaneously, enabling users to interact with both apps at the same time. Because of its toll on hardware and system resources, Split View is exclusive to the latest generation iPads.

Split View can be considered Slide Over's offspring: it can only be activated by entering Slide Over first and tapping a vertical divider that will put both apps (primary and secondary) side by side, active at the same time. In Split View, the app switcher for the secondary app is the same one used for Slide Over, too.

![In Slide Over, the divider can be tapped to enter Split  View.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-192906.jpeg)

> _Safari in Split View, and the Split View app picker._

There is no other way to activate Split View in iOS 9: the feature is entirely based on Slide Over, both in terms of design and user manipulation. If you want, you can move between Slide Over and Split View by tapping the divider and iOS 9 will cycle through the two modes.

Split View uses regular and compact size classes for three possible layouts. Before iOS 9, iPad apps always used regular size classes for both vertical and horizontal orientations as they ran in full-screen mode all the time. With Split View, the vertical size class is always regular, but the horizontal size class can change to compact. The diagram below shows how Split View affects size classes for iPad apps.

![Size classes.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-193223.jpeg)

> _Size classes._

When in Split View, the user can control the size of the app window by dragging the divider to switch between layouts. This is best experienced with Split View in landscape, where the secondary app can be resized to use 25% or 50% of the screen.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-193442.jpeg)

For the 75/25 layout in landscape, Apple apps that are primary tend to keep roughly the same full-size layout they'd normally have, shrinking and putting some buttons closer together where necessary; in the 50/50 mode, though, apps tend to resize more and switch to iPhone-inspired hybrid layouts, usually by moving some top buttons to a bottom toolbar (Safari) or by turning sidebars into cards (Reminders).

The most important difference between Slide Over and Split View is that while Slide Over forces a compact app onto the one you're in with no consequence on the primary app that stays in the background, Split View requires both apps to support multitasking with compact and regular size classes. Split View needs two iOS 9 apps updated for multitasking, otherwise you won't be able to split the screen in two.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-193552.jpeg)

If Split View isn't supported in an app you're using, you'll notice that Slide Over won't have a vertical divider running across the left side of the secondary app. When writing this review, I used Ole Zorn's Editorial: the app didn't support iOS 9 multitasking, so I could use Slide Over to interact with a secondary app, but I couldn't enter Split View.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-193945.jpeg)

If Split View is supported, you can tap the divider and iOS will bring the primary app in the foreground, prepare its layout, and present you with two apps on screen at the same time. The process takes less than a second on the iPad Air 2; after tapping and before entering Split View, the primary app (which was in the background) is blurred and its icon and name are shown on top of it to indicate which app you're about to use Split View with.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-194554.jpeg)

When resizing apps in Split View, both app screens will be blurred (iOS doesn't want to show you the app-resizing process in real-time), and you'll get the Split View counterparts upon releasing the divider - again, it takes less than a second.

There's a nice detail worth mentioning about resizing apps. When you're dragging the divider to resize apps in Split View, it will turn white and both apps will slightly recess in the background to communicate they're being manipulated by the user.

Dragging the divider is also how apps are dismissed and how you can return to a full-screen app. To leave Split View manually, you have to grab the divider and swipe right to put the secondary back into the app switcher, or swipe left to dismiss the primary app and make the secondary app full-screen (primary). The process works the same way in both directions, with an app undocking from Split View as you reach the edge of the screen through an animation that pulls it away from the adjacent app and that dims it. It's a delightful transition, smoothly animated on the iPad Air 2.

In my experience, Apple's approach has been working well: when they have to adopt compact layouts in Split View, landscape apps are somewhat reminiscent of an iPad mini inside an iPad Air 2 - you can tell they're using iPad layouts, only smaller.

Other times, Apple uses a few tricks to mix and match elements of iPhone interfaces with iPad UIs to save on space, but the end result is not annoying thanks to conventions of the iOS platform. And when they're using narrow layouts for Slide Over and Split View, iPad apps almost transform into smaller iPhone versions with longer layouts, which is fine for quick interactions. The constraints that Apple has put in place ensure you never end up with odd or uncomfortable app layouts, and that is the best design decision behind Split View and the new multitasking initiative as a whole.

Split View is an _option_. You're not relinquishing control of the traditional iOS experience when switching to Split View, and you don't have to use it if you don't want to. Apps don't launch in Split View mode by default: while on a Mac apps launch in windowed mode and full-screen is optional, the opposite is still true on iOS 9. Apps are, first and foremost, a full-screen affair on iOS, and the way Apple designed Split View doesn't suggest that is changing any time soon.

Split View isn't like window management on a desktop: Apple wanted to eschew the complexities of traditional PC multitasking and windowing systems, and by rethinking the entire concept around size classes and direct touch manipulation, they've largely achieved this goal. They have created _new_ complexities specific to iOS and touch, but it's undeniable that Slide Over and Split View are far from the annoyances inherent to window management on OS X. The iPad is fighting to be a computer and Split View epitomizes this desire, but it doesn't want to inherit the worst parts of multitasking from desktop computers.

"User control without unlimited freedom" would be a good way to describe Split View. While the user controls when Split View is activated and when it should be dismissed, Apple has (rightly) shied away from granting users the ability to resize app screens manually, have multiple overlapping windows on screen, or overcomplicate the divider with additional menus.

The [competition](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1_A9xISuU90) (and some [jailbreak tweaks](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/06/30/mimir-multiple-apps-multitasking-ios-8-3/)) had set a precedent for this; instead, Apple has shown remarkable restraint in building a split-screen feature which requires minimal management.

As a result, apps in Split View don't feel like windows at all: users never get to choose an app's position beyond its primary or secondary state; they can't drag an app in a corner and put three apps on screen with draggable resize controls. The screen splits to accommodate two apps - and that's it. It's easy to grasp, fast, and it feels natural on the Air 2.

For a long time, I thought that Apple wouldn't bring this kind of multitasking to the iPad because of the complexity therein, but Split View changed my mind. Unlike windows on OS X, I don't have to [worry about overlapping windows and apps to manage windows](http://atp.fm/episodes/96), which is liberating. I may not be able to look at five apps at the same time, but how often do I need that many apps at the same time anyway?

The fact that Split View is going to be available on El Capitan as well speaks for itself. Windows are great, but managing them usually isn't. Starting fresh with Split View feels like the best option for the iPad. This isn't a case of [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome): limitations and an intuitive design truly open up new possibilities that aren't weighed down by confusion or complexity.

Take the iPad's camera for example. In theory, by putting two apps that are capable of taking pictures and videos in Split View, you should be able to look at an iOS camera in two places. But that's not how it works in iOS 9. If you try to snap a photo in two apps when Split View is on, iOS will pause any existing instance of the camera, so you won't be able to look at the same scene from two different apps.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-194856.jpeg)

This feels right given the relationship between hardware and software on iOS: there is only one camera that takes advantage of an iPad's processor and volume controls to take pictures. Rather than bringing additional complexity to the camera APIs[24](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/11/), Apple designed Split View with clear boundaries that serve the user experience.

At the same time, they've also given developers the ability to opt out of Split View if they don't want their apps to support it. While I suspect that most iPad apps updated for iOS 9 will work with Split View, it's likely that games meant to be played in full-screen with deeper access to the iPad's hardware and resources won't feature Split View integration. This is fair when you consider the increased memory pressure on a complex 3D game that needs to share the screen with another advanced app or game, but I'd still love to see a Split View-enabled [Minecraft](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) running alongside a guide to the game or a live chat.

Split View breeds a new set of limitations and complexities, but it doesn't fall in the trap of imitating PC multitasking. Taken at face value, Split View really is just a way to use two apps at the same time. As we'll explore later on, that "just" is part of a bigger picture that goes beyond the idea of multiple app screens, with exciting possibilities worth addressing.

### Picture in Picture

If you ask any average tech blogger (or [YouTuber](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/642354220918816768)), they'll tell you that the iPad is all about "consumption". While this simplistic reduction of the iPad's role in millions of people's lives has been proven inaccurate time and time again, it is true that people love to consume videos on their iPads. And for good reason: the iPad - even in the mini version - makes for a compelling portable player with a fantastic screen and a vast selection of video apps from YouTube and Netflix to VEVO, Plex, HBO, MLB, and thousands more. It wouldn't be absurd to say that the iPad ushered the Internet in the era of modern, [Flash-free video streaming and portable playback](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/). But it also wouldn't be too outlandish to argue that the iPad's video player is a relic from five years ago. iOS 9's Picture in Picture wants to address this problem.

These days, we check our Facebook feeds while we listen to songs on YouTube and we tweet while we're streaming the latest Game of Thrones or a live baseball game. Video is not a one-app experience anymore. This has been the case on the desktop for years since the advent of media players and YouTube, but our primary sources of video entertainment are smartphones, tablets, and TVs. Due to the absence of a great app experience on the TV we've come to rely on phones to multitask while watching video. Shouldn't a better option be available on the iPad, a device that is big enough to host simultaneous video playback and other apps?

Even if we move beyond the tweet-while-watching-TV use case, there is an argument to be made about the utility of a video player that can coexist with apps in a multitasking environment. How many times have you wished you could rewatch any kind of technical session recorded on video while taking notes on your iPad at the same time? Follow an Apple live stream while tweeting, without having to use a Mac for that? How about watching a Minecraft tutorial while playing the game itself? For all the advances of the iPad and iOS platform in recent years, playing video on iOS is still a disruptive experience that requires complete attention. On iOS, video takes over everything else, and it's easily interrupted as soon as you go back to the Home screen or tap a notification.

With Picture in Picture, Apple is taking a page from [Google's YouTube app](http://www.macstories.net/news/youtube-2-0-for-ios-released-with-picture-in-picture-updated-design/) and they're bringing a floating video player to the iPad.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-195645.jpeg)

Integrated with the native media player and FaceTime in iOS 9, Picture in Picture turns a video into a resizable box that floats on top of everything and that follows you around everywhere. If you watch a lot of video on iPad, PiP (as it's also affectionately called by Apple) is easily going to be one of your favorite features in this update.

Like Slide Over, Picture in Picture is available on the following iPad models:

  * iPad mini 2
  * iPad mini 3
  * iPad mini 4
  * iPad Air
  * iPad Air 2
  * iPad Pro

For developers, Picture in Picture support can be enabled for apps that use the AVKit, AV Foundation, or WebKit class for video playback.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-195420.jpeg)

Picture in Picture works like this: when you're playing a video in an app updated for iOS 9 (such as Videos) or from Safari, a Picture in Picture button will appear in the lower right corner of the standard media player. Tap it, and the video will shrink into a floating player that you can drag around and that docks to the edges of the screen (or on top of Control Center and the keyboard if shown).

Picture in Picture shows a progress bar and offers buttons to play/pause, close the video player, and take the video back into the original app, dismissing the floating player. You can't scrub through a video in Picture in Picture - you'll have to go back to the player app for that.

Picture in Picture doesn't only work by manually activating it: whenever you leave an app that's playing a video by clicking the Home button or tapping a notification, the video will shrink to Picture in Picture and it'll follow you across apps.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-223044.jpeg)

The behavior is slightly different for FaceTime video calls. Depending on the orientation of the caller's device, FaceTime's PiP will be taller than regular video; it'll also have buttons to mute, return to the FaceTime app, and end a call instead of controlling playback. Like normal Picture in Picture, FaceTime PiP is activated when leaving a video call on the FaceTime app by clicking the Home button or opening a notification.

Under the hood, Picture in Picture works by integrating with three of iOS' media player frameworks (including WebKit, so Safari and web views should get PiP support out of the box) and pushing the video player into an upper layer of iOS' structure, giving the user control on positioning, size, and playback (as you can see, a recurring theme in iPad multitasking). Because it's meant to be treated as always-playing background media, Picture in Picture floats on top of every app and menu; it sits on the same layer of Control Center, and it can only be obscured by Notification Center.

The only places where PiP doesn't show up are the system app switcher (although it does float over the Slide Over/Split View one) and the Lock screen. Picture in Picture has been designed to be available anywhere you go: it joins the likes of background audio, VoIP, navigation, and Phone/FaceTime calls as the only features capable of continuing until completion following a click of the Home button.

Like Slide Over and Split View, one of Picture in Picture's tenets is the lack of complex management required to operate it. Playback controls disappear in the video player after a few seconds (you can reveal them again by tapping the PiP). You can move the PiP around by dragging it, and you'll notice that it'll snap to a corner of the screen as soon as you release your finger. This is meant to remove the burden of precise positioning that affects desktop apps: there's no concept of grid spacing or pixel-snapping for windows here; just loose gestures and automatic docking to the closest edge and available space on screen.[25](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/12/)

You can pinch and rotate the PiP, but it'll always reposition itself to the correct orientation; you can also pinch and zoom to enlarge it and pinch close to make the player smaller. You cannot make the PiP as big as you want - just like you don't have that kind of precise control over the layouts of Split View.

> _Hidden Picture in Picture, automatically placed above Control Center._

If you want to keep watching a video but it doesn't require your undivided attention or if Picture in Picture is getting in the way, you can swipe it out of view and it'll attach to the edge of the screen. When hidden, video will continue playing in the background, and the Picture in Picture box will display a pulling indicator along the side of the screen that you can grab to bring the video in the foreground again. This is a handy addition for all those times when you'd want a video to keep playing just for the audio while retaining the ability to watch it if needed.

With a total of four screen regions where it can be shown[26](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/12/), four where it can be hidden, and five possible sizes, iOS 9's Picture in Picture gives you the freedom to watch video anywhere while also ensuring this flexibility doesn't make the iOS experience cumbersome and confusing.

Picture in Picture embodies many of the post-PC principles: it's uniquely built for touch and it's not burdened by the expectations of traditional PC window management.

Picture in Picture benefits from the clean slate of iOS and the direct interactions of multitouch. You can throw it around and it'll gain momentum and stick to the closest corner in the direction of your swipe. It feels natural and credible.[27](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/12/) The combination of gestures, intelligent layering, drop shadows, believable physics, and, more importantly, great performance makes Picture in Picture feel joyfully material and, ultimately, practical.

With Picture in Picture, my iPad has gone from being incredibly worse than a Mac to watch videos to drastically superior in one fell swoop. The simplicity and cohesiveness of Picture in Picture are remarkable: whenever I come across a video in Safari, I can click the Home button knowing that it'll stay with me. I can even start watching another video, and Picture in Picture will automatically pause and resume later. If I tried to do the same on a Mac, I'd have to manually resize windows, perhaps install some third-party apps, and learn a combination of keyboard shortcuts. On the iPad, it's just a button.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-200740.jpeg)

It didn't take me long to realize that Picture in Picture was going to be a terrific reimagination of video playback on iPad. I was watching [John Gruber's interview with Phil Schiller for The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123) at WWDC, and I noticed that I could put the HTML5 video player in Picture in Picture. That led to a fantastic experience: as I was watching and listening, I could open Twitter and tweet a few comments about it without stopping the video, and I could put Safari and Notes in Split View while also playing the video to simultaneously watch, research, and take notes about Schiller's comments. _That_ was true multitasking, and it helped me be part of a conversation around a live event without regretting my use of an iPad to watch video. The same experience wouldn't have been possible with iOS 8.

I've been enjoying Picture in Picture to keep FaceTime video calls going while I do something else, too. Like other types of video, FaceTime used to require my complete attention: if I wanted to have a video call with someone on my iPad, I had to stop whatever I was doing. Now I'm always putting FaceTime video calls in Picture in Picture, which has turned out to be a fantastic lifehack to help my parents out with iOS issues (I can look at their computer screen and my iPad's web browser at the same time).

Picture in Picture doesn't only level the playing field between iPad and other platforms for video playback - it makes the iPad substantially better thanks to its integration with other multitasking features.

I still have some questions and concerns about Picture in Picture, though. Because of Apple's implementation, developers can choose not to support it. Will YouTube support Picture in Picture if it helps avoiding ads and annotations on a video? Will Netflix and HBO?

There's always a tension between new iOS features and the best interests of large companies: the incentives of a system integration aren't always aligned with the companies' business model. Ideally, Picture in Picture will become _so_ popular that it'll be impossible for YouTube to ignore it, but [as we've seen with Twitter before](https://www.macstories.net/ios/twitter-adds-ios-8-share-sheet-support-to-iphone-app/), big companies can be exceptionally resilient _and_ shortsighted when the question turns to being good platform citizens. In the short term, I'm also curious to see if Apple itself will support Picture in Picture with its Music app: right now, videos available in Apple Music don't support it at all.

Picture in Picture is to video what Control Center is to audio. As we increasingly rely on our iPads to watch video, Apple realized it was time to make video playback its own layer, always available across the system, always under the user's control but free of the complexities that such design would entail on a desktop computer. Picture in Picture is uniquely suited for touch and iOS; I wonder if it'll ever come to the iPhone as well.

### Software Keyboard

When the iPad was introduced in 2010, Apple praised the full-screen, laptop-like keyboard that allowed for a comfortable and familiar typing experience. For years, the company stuck to that ideal, modeling the iPad's keyboard after how a Mac's keyboard would work, with some exceptions made possible by software.

Apple brought over popup keys (for accented letters and other symbols) from the iPhone; they added a dictation button; they even got creative by demonstrating the awkward efficiency of the almost-forgotten split keyboard for iPad, introduced in 2011. Last year, we began to see the first cracks in the software keyboard wall with custom keyboards for iOS 8, which enabled users to use non-Apple keyboards on their devices.

Apple has always taken its software keyboards seriously, and that's resulted in a slow evolution compared to keyboards on other platforms. As we've seen with San Francisco, though, 2015 Apple is more open to the idea of tweaking the keyboard they've long held in high regard.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-200921.jpeg)

First up is the Shortcut Bar, an extension of the QuickType bar that enables apps to put actions and menus next to QuickType suggestions. Available as monochromatic glyphs, these shortcuts are used by Apple across the OS with Undo, Redo, and Paste actions, and they're often customized for specific apps to offer access to features that aren't as easily accessible in the UI - or that sometimes aren't accessible at all.

At its simplest state, the Shortcut Bar acts as a way to undo/redo operations and paste (both text and any other data). Because shortcuts are programmable, they can change depending on context: when you select text, for instance, undo and redo become cut and copy so they can work alongside paste.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-201053.jpeg)

Because Shortcuts can be disabled, copy & paste options are still available in the classic popup menu, so you may have the same options in two places.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-201241.jpeg)

It gets more interesting when Apple ties entire menus and iOS integrations to the Shortcut Bar. In Mail, the right side has buttons to bring up a popover for text styling, one to pick a photo or video, and another to show the iOS document picker to attach a file to a message. Both attachment options are also available in the copy & paste menu, but icons in the Shortcut Bar make them more visible and obvious: they're always displayed even if you're not selecting text.

In Notes, the Shortcut Bar is used to offer a unified redo/undo/copy shortcut (it uses a popover), a button to create a checklist, and another to show a text style popover on the left side of the keyboard. On the right side, there are shortcuts to add a photo or video to a note and create a sketch.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-201542.jpeg)

I'm a fan of the Shortcut Bar. Fast access to a subset of app menus and actions trumps similar shortcuts available in the copy & paste menu, especially because they only require one tap and can present interfaces right above the keyboard. I wasn't using QuickType suggestions before iOS 9, but the Shortcut Bar pushed me to enable the additional keyboard row.

Third-party developers will be able to provide their buttons for the Shortcut Bar, and I'm curious to see what they'll do in their apps.

In iOS 9, the [UITextInput](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextInput_Protocol/) protocol has been enhanced with the ability to provide a UIBarButtonItem within a UITextInputAssistantItem object, which will be displayed in the Shortcut Bar. Developers can specify the placement of shortcuts, choosing between left (leading) and right (trailing). Any action can be associated to a button in the Shortcut Bar as it behaves like a [UIBarButtonItem](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIBarButtonItem_Class/) that is typically found in a toolbar or a navigation controller.

> _The share sheet can be tied to the Shortcut Bar, too._

The few betas of iOS 9 apps I could test sported shortcuts to navigate between text fields, add attachments to a note, or share content with the tap of a button. Developer Daniel Breslan showed me a demo of popups and share sheets triggered from the Shortcut Bar; in Drafts 4.5, users will be able to [turn custom keys into Shortcut Bar items](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise/status/639881863239069697?p=p), which will be displayed alongside QuickType to perform actions on the current draft.

The Shortcut Bar is an ingenious way to use the extra space of the iPad keyboard to save a bit of time with preconfigured actions. Apple is providing some good examples in their default apps; hopefully, third-party developers will use their imagination for this aspect of iOS 9 as well.[28](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/13/)

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-202257.jpeg)

I've been covering iOS for a few years now, and I've regularly lamented the lack of faster text selection and editing controls on iPad. Since its inception in 2007 and update for iPad support in 2010, text selection on iOS has left much to be desired, particularly for those looking to compose and edit long pieces of text.

When it was posted on YouTube in 2012, the [Hooper Selection](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQTaHGQ04Q) ([according to the creator](https://twitter.com/danielchooper/status/607972899442421760), the single most duped radar at Apple) wasn't only clever as most concept videos: it felt inevitable and it embodied the multitouch nature of iOS. As [I wrote back then](https://www.macstories.net/news/concept-video-shows-new-text-selection-method-for-ipad/), it made a lot of sense.

Three years after Hooper's popular concept, Apple has listened to the community and used the Hooper Selection as the basis for the new trackpad mode on iOS 9 for iPad.

![Selecting text in trackpad mode with a two-finger tap &  hold + swipe.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-202548.jpeg)

> _Selecting text in trackpad mode with a two-finger tap_

The core proposition of trackpad mode is that you can swipe with two fingers on the keyboard to freely move the cursor around and control its placement in a text field. It works like you'd expect from a trackpad on your Mac: characters disappear from keys as soon as you start swiping, indicating that you're free to use the whole area as a trackpad.

There's no sound effect accompanying cursor placement in trackpad mode, but there is one subtle visual cue that hints at the connection between the native iOS cursor and trackpad mode. When first placing two fingers on the keyboard, the cursor will animate to split in two: the main cursor (which can have a custom color set by the developer) will loosely follow your swiping direction even if it's outside the bounds of a text field, and a smaller gray cursor will more precisely track your intention and be attached to characters. It sounds more complex than it actually is in practice - a testament to the fact that intuitive touch text selection is a tricky problem to solve.

Trackpad mode isn't limited to cursor placement, as it can also be used to control text selection. Tap with two fingers on the keyboard and iOS will select the word closest to the cursor; keep swiping left or right, and you'll extend your selection. Or, hold two fingers on the keyboard, wait for the cursor to transform into the text selection controls (with another nice transition), and then start extending your selection by swiping.

Easier text selection through swipes on the keyboard fixes a _major_ annoyance of editing text on iPad. While the direct relationship between words, selection, and touch could be appreciated in the early days of iOS, it slowed down the entire process after people figured it out and just wanted to be more efficient when selecting and editing text.

Apple's new trackpad mode works well with the Shortcut Bar: the iPad keyboard now encompasses selecting, editing, and performing actions with a unified interface. This shows how Apple is staying true to the multitouch promise of the original iOS keyboard: the unique advantage of touch keyboards is that [you can always update them](http://daringfireball.net/misc/2010/03/smartphones.jpg). Trackpad mode is a good example of that kind of mindset. It's still the same keyboard, but now you can do more with it.

In my tests, trackpad mode performance has been solid and gesture recognition fairly accurate with some instances of accidental text selections and the cursor becoming stuck in a text field. Nothing that couldn't be fixed by swiping again or tapping a letter to "reset" the keyboard.[29](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/13/)

I've been using trackpad mode to edit posts I publish to MacStories every day, and I believe it is superior to what we had before. Trackpad mode doesn't make the iPad more like a Mac: it is only available for text editing, and rather than "putting a mouse on the iPad" it uses multitouch to bring a new behavior for the software keyboard. I find trackpad mode to be smooth and natural: I'm particularly fond of its precise character control, which has been a boon to fix typos in Editorial and manage text selections in Notes.

Apple may have Hooper to thank for inspiring trackpad mode years ago, but iOS 9's implementation is all theirs. Trackpad mode is well suited for the large iPad display, and it's good to see Apple trying new things with multitouch again.

  1. On a related note, I don't think it's too crazy to imagine third-party shortcut extensions as system-wide options, similar to custom keyboards, but as accessories to Apple's software keyboard. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/13/)
  2. It's worth mentioning that, in some apps, you're not limited to swiping on the keyboard to control cursor and text selection: you can swipe anywhere on the text field (even if the software keyboard isn't shown because you're using an external keyboard) to move the cursor and select text. This is less intuitive than using the keyboard as a trackpad; you can try it with Notes if you're curious. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/13/)
  


### Hardware Keyboards

With iOS 7, Apple [introduced](https://www.macstories.net/tutorials/a-list-of-new-ios-7-keyboard-shortcuts/) support for programmable shortcuts on external Bluetooth keyboards. While iOS supported system-wide commands for text formatting and undo back in the early days of the iPad, iOS 7 allowed developers to add custom shortcuts to their apps.

Adoption of the feature didn't work out as expected. Apple was inconsistent in their usage of keyboard shortcuts: some apps didn't support them at all; others had full sets of shortcuts matching those available in the same app for OS X; others, like Messages[30](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/14/), only supported _some_ of the shortcuts available on the Mac. Even worse, there was no API to inform the user about keyboard shortcuts: while Mac apps could use the menu bar as a place where users could click around and learn shortcuts, the same wasn't the case on the iPad. Support for keyboard shortcuts in iPad apps was sporadic, poorly documented, and [we even tried to create a webpage](https://www.macstories.net/keyboard-shortcuts-for-ios-7-apps/) to showcase shortcuts supported by popular apps. It's fair to say that the class used to register keyboard shortcuts, [UIKeyCommand](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKeyCommand_class/), failed to gain traction among users and developers in 2013.

With iOS 9, Apple has reworked the OS' support for external keyboard shortcuts. In the process, they've given developers a unified way to teach users about shortcuts and they've also brought over some great time-saving commands from OS X.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-224115.jpeg)

Keyboard shortcuts can be specific to a single view controller and apps can now display a cheat sheet with a list of supported shortcuts. The cheat sheet, called Discoverability, is an overlay that appears in the middle of the screen upon holding the Command key on a keyboard. In Discoverability, each app will be able to list the shortcuts it supports with labels and required key combinations. Developers can choose to assign labels to keyboard shortcuts with the optional `discoverabilityTitle` property of UIKeyCommand; while an unlimited number of shortcuts can be set in an app, only those with an associated label will be displayed (according to the order set by the developer) in the Discoverability overlay.

Discoverability is a notable change as it helps exposing keyboard shortcuts in a consistent way: instead of having to read through an app's About page, you can press a single key on the keyboard to get a system-wide cheat sheet for each app that exposes keyboard shortcuts.

Assigning shortcuts on a per-view controller basis is also a welcome change from iOS 7. In iOS 9, developers can program subsets of shortcuts that are enabled in specific views of their apps, which will then appear in Discoverability only when you're in that section. In Safari, for instance, the list of shortcuts will be slightly different depending on whether you're on a webpage or the browser's Favorites view[31](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/14/); in Notes, the Find Note shortcut will only be supported in a list of notes and not in the main view of the app.

![Different shortcuts depending on an app's view.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-224627.jpeg)

> _Different shortcuts depending on an app's view._

This is another instance of iOS 9 adopting the best features of OS X without their burden: because shortcuts are only listed in Discoverability when they can be used, there's no concept of unavailable, grayed-out shortcuts in iOS 9. If you see a shortcut in Discoverability, you can try it and it'll do something. In the months I've spent exploring the keyboard shortcuts supported by Apple in iOS 9, this has proven to be a better implementation than the often-unavailable, non-contextual shortcuts listed in the menu bar drop-downs of Mac apps.

The increased flexibility of UIKeyCommand and Discoverability should make for a quicker adoption of keyboard shortcuts among third-party apps. As far as Apple goes, they've done a good job at supporting shortcuts in their apps and being more in line with what they offer on OS X. Messages can now _finally_ send by pressing the Return key; Mail, Safari, and Calendar offer a good selection of shortcuts to navigate the UI, switch between views, and perform actions; some apps don't have shortcut support (Podcasts, Photos, App Store), but it's no big deal.

Where Apple also surprised me is in the Home screen shortcuts that are actually available as _system-wide options_. Go to the Home screen, press Command, and notice how iOS 9 supports Command-Tab and Command-Space? Those aren't just commands you can use on the Home screen: you can Command-Tab through apps and open Search from _anywhere_ on iOS 9.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-223540.jpeg)

Modeled after the equivalent shortcut for OS X, Command-Space allows you to launch iOS' Spotlight. However, unlike OS X's Spotlight, the search panel on iOS doesn't come up as a system-wide popup; instead, pressing Command-Space will take you to the Spotlight section that is normally accessed by swiping down on the Home screen (more on this later). Essentially, Command-Space acts as a more traditional implementation of the dedicated Spotlight key that iPad keyboards from third-party companies have exhibited for the past few years. It would have been nice to see a modal Spotlight available across the entire OS; for now, this will do - if only in terms of muscle memory for those coming from OS X.

The Command-Tab app switcher is a real treat. If you're used to Command-Tabbing on your Mac, you'll feel right at home on iOS 9 for iPad. Pressing the shortcut will bring up an overlay with app icons (nine in landscape, six in portrait), which you can cycle through by pressing Tab again; like on OS X, Command-Shift-Tab cycles through apps in reverse order.

There is one key difference between OS X and iOS 9 for Command-Tab: while OS X employs the Command-Tab switcher to enable users to move across open apps, the concept of "open" app is more blurred on iOS. For this reason, Apple chose to bring Command-Tab to iOS as a way to jump between recently used apps.

Like the iOS app switcher puts the last app you used front and center in the UI, hitting Command-Tab on iOS 9 immediately highlights that app, so you can lift your fingers off the keyboard to switch back to it. Therefore, it's best to think of iOS 9's Command-Tab as a faster, keyboard-based version of the system app switcher, limited to the most recent apps and aimed at letting you jump between them, regardless of their state.

The improved support for external keyboards in iOS 9 is a step in the right direction. iOS 7 was a timid and inconsistent attempt at offering shortcuts for apps. iOS 9 feels like a more complete thought around external keyboards and their relationship with OS features and apps.

However, for two step forwards, there's one step back for Apple here: new multitasking functionalities such as Picture in Picture, Slide Over, and Split View don't have any sort of integration with external keyboards. I suppose that these new features have led to more questions for Apple engineers, but this is not an impossible problem to fix. A way to activate Slide Over and Split View and Picture in Picture shortcuts would help a lot.

There's still a long way to go for iOS to gain full independence from touch when a physical keyboard is connected, and we'll probably never get to that point. iOS is, ultimately, a multitouch platform and external keyboards are an option - they're not meant to be treated as the _only_ input system of an iPad.

From such standpoint, it's easy to pardon Apple for not supporting the new multitasking features, Control Center, Notification Center, navigation in the search page, or actionable notifications with keyboard shortcuts. The deeper you get into iOS' architecture, the harder it becomes to justify an input method that doesn't involve touch.

### The Spatiality of iPad Multitasking

With new multitasking features, Apple had to rethink parts of the core structure of iOS for iPad. This has introduced novel challenges and complexities, some of which haven't been addressed in this release.

While Slide Over reinforces the idea of primary and secondary app by dimming the primary app in the background, such distinction isn't available for Split View. There's a reason for that: Split View is meant to let you use two apps at the same time, and downgrading one of them to a lesser state would diminish the idea that you're able to interact with two apps on screen. But this poses a question when the keyboard is shown: where are you typing?

![Hint: look at the 'Done' button.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-225144.jpeg)

> _Hint: look at the 'Done' button._

With the current Split View design, there is no strong indicator of which app is receiving input from the iOS keyboard. There is _an_ indicator - the blinking cursor - but it's not persistent or clear enough if you need to discern where the keyboard is going to type into.

I don't believe this will turn out to be a major problem in practice: in using iOS 9 on my iPad, occasionally typing into the wrong app in Split View hasn't made me long for the simpler times of full-screen apps. Still, as a mere design critique, I believe Apple could figure out ways to better indicate the relationship between apps in Split View and the keyboard. In the meantime, I'd advise developers to strongly consider unique tint colors for the text cursor to help increase visual recognition.

The concept of active app state (or lack thereof) gets worse when you're using an external keyboard. Let's play this game again: which app is listening for keyboard shortcuts now?

A problem that is somewhat eased by the blinking cursor turns into a bigger usability concern when the cursor isn't displayed but input is still accepted through an external keyboard. With Discoverability and keyboard shortcuts, you'll end up with a case of Schrodinger's Split View: an app is both active and inactive at the same time, and your perspective is all that matters. Or, rather, a single touch matters: the app receiving keyboard shortcuts will be the one where the keyboard was last shown. If you put two apps with a text field side by side, you can tap one after the other to change what Discoverability thinks it's the active app.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-225538.jpeg)

This is not obvious, and you can test it by putting two apps in Split View, connecting a Bluetooth keyboard, and holding Command while tapping both apps' text fields. The Discoverability overlay will move between the two according to what iOS interprets as last-used and therefore actively-receiving-external-input app. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways that Apple could go to improve the visual structure of Split View - for example, the shared status bar could be a good place for an active app indicator.

> _You can "fake" multiple instances of Safari by putting Safari View Controller next to Safari in Split View._

One of the key aspects of Slide Over and Split View is that they cannot show two sections of the same app at once. Only individual apps can be displayed concurrently on screen: you can't split Safari in multiple views and display both views on screen at the same time. If you were hoping to manage multiple Safari tabs or Pages documents in Split View, you're out of luck.

Splitting apps into multiple atomic units for standalone views and documents seems like an obvious next step going forward. If Apple wants to do this, the redesigned system app switcher and its heavily card-influenced design[32](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/15/) could be used to group multiple instances of an app together in a stack.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-225954.jpeg)

Today, Split View doesn't support multiple views of the same app. I wouldn't bet on that always being the case in the future.

Where Apple's multitasking architecture gets more questionable is in the thread that runs through Slide Over, Split View, and the classic app switcher.

In iOS 9, there isn't a 1:1 relationship between the app switcher and other multitasking features. The idea of "recent" app is muddled when the system has to account for multiple apps displayed on screen, but Apple could have handled some parts of this differently.

When you put a secondary app in Slide Over or Split View, that app disappears from the system app switcher. Instead of being displayed as a smaller card to the right of the current app, it's completely hidden from the switcher's UI. When in Split View, the secondary app is an empty rectangle on the right side of the primary app.

![That empty area next to Twitterrific is a secondary app in Split View.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-230227.jpeg)

> _That empty area next to Twitterrific is a secondary app in Split View._

I assume that Apple didn't want to bring distinct touch targets to each card in the switcher; my issue is that this looks like a bug, and users should have the ability to resume Split View through a preview of both apps. Hiding the secondary app in the switcher is also a mistake as it prevents users from retrieving an app the traditional way.

In an ideal state, iOS would honor the placement of primary and secondary apps. They would both be displayed in the app switcher when active; their position would always be the same as you move across the OS and all of its different ways to launch apps.

On some level, iOS does exactly this: when you're in Split View and return to the Home screen, opening another app that supports it will launch that app in Split View automatically, bringing in the secondary app from the right side again. This is good design: clicking the Home button when in Split View (and Slide Over) pushes the secondary app into the right edge of the screen before going to the Home screen, a transition that highlights the spatiality of multitasking and the division between primary and secondary app. iOS even remembers Split View if you quit the primary app and open it again, or after a device restart.

Apple made a good call in making Slide Over and Split View as "sticky" as possible, and _especially_ Split View feels like a feature that can be left on all the time. It could be debated whether iOS should offer settings to launch apps and notifications in the secondary app pane[33](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/15/), but this is a good start.

Another problem occurs when the order of recent apps is overridden by the app switcher used in Slide Over and Split View. It took me a long time to figure this out, but here goes: the app switcher used in these two modes doesn't show the same list of recent apps you see in the system app switcher (the one that comes up with a double-click on the Home button). Instead:

  * The Slide Over app switcher only shows apps that support Slide Over (of course);
  * Of these apps, the first three icons (from the bottom) are the apps you've recently used in Slide Over and Split View;
  * From the fourth icon and upwards in the switcher, you'll see the same order of recent apps as they appear in the system app switcher, regardless of whether you used them in Slide Over and Split View recently.

I couldn't make out the reason behind this choice initially. Now, I see Apple's motivation and the kind of experience they're going for - but it could be a confusing one for those accustomed to a certain spatiality in the app switcher.

![One order here...](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-230557.jpeg)

> _...another here._

Apple thinks that most users will tend to frequently use the same apps in Slide Over and Split View. Whether it's an iMessage next to a webpage in Safari or a mind map alongside a podcast episode, the new multitasking app switcher is built on the assumption that frequency of use is more convenient than hierarchy and spatiality at all costs. From a design perspective, it's an interesting conundrum: would it be better to always display the same order of apps when double-clicking the Home button and swiping from the right edge of the screen, or does the new app switcher deserve its own layer of "recently used" apps that can override whatever you recently used outside of Slide Over and Split View?

It took me a while to warm to this idea, but after a few months I see Apple's perspective and they have a point. When I'm doing something that requires interacting with two apps at the same time, I tend to go back to the same pair of apps over and over. Mail next to Safari to open links in a web browser (and great to unsubscribe from unwanted newsletters) and Messages next to Calendar; [iThoughts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughts-mindmap/id866786833?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) in Slide Over when I'm writing in Editorial. I have developed my own workflows and routines for multitasking on iOS 9, and, while on principle the spatiality of the main app switcher should be respected, _in practice_ altering the first three apps to be the ones you last used in Slide Over and Split View leads to a faster, more efficient way to multitask. Moving between apps in Slide Over and Split View is faster because of this design.

![The redesigned app switcher puts the last used app front and center.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-231118.jpeg)

> _The redesigned app switcher puts the last used app front and center._

The system app switcher itself has been redesigned with cards that display an app's icon and name at the top of a preview of its last state; along with the new look, the order has been reversed, so you'll now be swiping right to go back in the list of recently closed apps instead of going left.

I've been thinking about the redesigned app switcher a lot, and for a while I couldn't understand why Apple would want to change the app switcher other than to spice it up. From a design standpoint, I find the new switcher to be nicer and smoother than the old one[34](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/15/), but, on a spatial level, it would make more sense to keep the old left-to-right order to have the Slide Over/Split View app picker fit with the rest of the UI and spatiality of the feature (everything stays to the right).

I still can't find a single, perfectly solid argument in favor of the redesigned app switcher - just a few possible explanations.

  * By moving app names and icons to the top of the switcher, Apple has freed up space at the bottom of the UI, where they can now insert proactive recommendations for apps and Handoff.
  * It could be that the company realized that swiping right is a superior metaphor for _going back_ into your list of apps, which are displayed _before_ (to the left of) the app you're currently using and the Home screen, sort of like a timeline.
  * The revised order of the app switcher works better with iOS' support for back links and the new app-launching animation: back links shown in the status bar point left, _backwards_ in the list of recently used apps; launching apps (and tapping the Safari button for a Universal Link) moves forward now, pushing the current app to the left.
  * The new app switcher was made for 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s.

With Slide Over and Split View, Apple has allocated new UI layers to the limited space of an iPad. For the most part, the company has done a good job at keeping the resulting interactions as obvious as possible, but they've created peculiar edge cases and questions, too. As I've explored above, some of them haven't been addressed in this first version of iOS 9.0; given their extremely specific nature and, arguably, philosophical problem rather than practical inconvenience, I wouldn't be surprised if they'll take a long time to be "fixed".

The concept of direct manipulation in iOS makes considerations on the spatiality and physical consistency of software intriguing - Slide Over and Split View exist in their own UI and UX space, but they also have to coexist with features and layers that predate iOS 9. Spatially speaking, Slide Over and Split View have managed to find their place on iOS. Can the same be said at a visual level?

### The Visual Complexities of iPad Multitasking

Back in the old iPad days, there was [a certain romance](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CUGzWETn1HQ) about opening an app and knowing it would be the one and only app you could look at while it was active. It was a consistent, pure iteration of the iPhone's app model, glorified for a 10-inch screen and embellished by baroque textures of antique leather materials, fine exotic woods, and futuristic robot servants. It was, in many ways, beautiful.

Today, this is what you can achieve if you try really hard to push iOS and Split View to their limits:

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-232126.jpeg)

Over 10 layers of user interface displayed in a multitasking environment that involves two apps being used at the same time. Is this the same device that launched to reviews praising how fantastic it was to be forced to use one app at a time?

New features always bring new complexity, and true utility is found in the balance of increased functionality and added confusion. iOS 9 multitasking is no exception: it's powerful, but it also dramatically increases the amount of information being displayed on the iPad's screen.

We have to ask: is it too much?

If you consider Picture in Picture, Split View, Control Center, extensions, notifications, app menus, Command-Tab, and the system keyboard, an iPad can be as visually cluttered as a traditional desktop computer. Unlike a Mac, the iPad's screen real estate is limited and the software keyboard is part of the UI, which leaves even less room for app content to be displayed. Because of its touch constraints, iOS on an iPad Air 2 can even seem busier than OS X.

Consider Split View and Picture in Picture. Let's say you're working with Notes on the left and Safari on the right while watching a video via Picture in Picture. With both apps shown in landscape mode and the keyboard active, there isn't much room left for the video overlay, but you can keep it on either side if you don't always need to look at what you're writing or researching. There's already a lot going on.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-232514.jpeg)

Now you're in the middle of your note-taking session, Picture in Picture is playing, and you realize you need to work with an extension in Safari. Picture in Picture is displayed on top of Safari, and you hit the share icon to bring up the share sheet. What happens next?

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-232604.jpeg)

Because Picture in Picture sits on top of anything that is displayed underneath, the share sheet you just activated is fully hidden by the video player, which you'll need to move to the left - the only possible location at this point - if you want to use extensions. Fair? Yes, because Picture in Picture is purposefully designed to always follow you around. More complex than what we're used to on iOS? Also a "yes".

And it's not just Picture in Picture that raises questions on the visual clutter now possible on an iPad with iOS 9. What happens when you combine the split keyboard - it still exists! - with Picture in Picture and a bunch of share sheets? How about a custom keyboard, Split View, and Command-Tab? There's a lot of different styles and UI elements claiming their own space at once.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-232834.jpeg)

After using iOS 9 on my iPad for the past three months, I've wondered if Apple had gone too far in the name of productivity. The iPad used to be the friendly device that could be a calculator, a book, a newspaper, or the web in the palm of your hands. With iOS 9, we're presented with a device that can show dozens of layers of content at the same time, often from three different apps, with a UI design that doesn't bring back any feeling of familiarity from physical objects that you hold in your hands.

And that's okay.

For the iPad to grow up, new challenges and complexities ultimately have to be accepted. The entire point of this discussion - and the thread I've tried to develop in this chapter - isn't to argue that Apple should have built multitasking features with no complexity, but to observe how they reacted to the complexities they were destined to introduce all along.

The iPad can't be more without becoming more complex, but the way that complexity doesn't become _complicated_ is under Apple's control. With no restraint, we might have ended up like [this](http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/hires/2013/4-reviewsamsun.jpg). And to truly appreciate the fine balance struck between functionality and confusion, we need to look back at iOS 7.

If Apple hadn't redesigned iOS from the ground up with a focus on text, color, clarity, and content, I don't think iOS 9 multitasking would be as usable as it is today. Modern apps may have lost some of the craft and skills required to recreate realistic visuals, but as a result designers and developers now have to pay attention to aspects of functionality, accessibility, and inter-app communication that were largely ignored or glossed over before.

I've been writing about iOS apps for a while, and I'm not affected by any kind of nostalgia for the good old days of skeuomorphic trends. This isn't about taste: from a mere functional standpoint, iOS today is more legible, clear, and better prepared to support apps that work together.

By hitting the reset button on a design pendulum that had swung too far in favor of photorealism, Apple has created a more uniform, scalable iOS app ecosystem that feels _and_ works as a cohesive force instead of a bunch of fancy toys. It may be less "fun" for designers who don't have to spend weeks setting up a particular leather texture in Photoshop. But iOS today is better equipped for users of all types and needs, and true care for design is found in [how it serves people](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/), not in how much it's appreciated by fellow designers on Dribbble.

This is evident with new multitasking features in iOS 9 for iPad. When using two apps in Split View, you're likely not going to end up with a wooden shelf on the left side and a metallic cabinet on the other, all while a small video player with rounded corners floats around the screen projecting heavy shadow effects on top of everything. Instead, using Apple's apps (and third-party ones) in Split View feels like a unified, consistent experience: two pieces of software based on the same design language, not clashing with each other, distinct but homogenous. The more subdued, unassuming nature of the modern iOS makes sheets of content as well as entire apps feel like part of a whole system - multiple components of the same machine and not competing protagonists of the same stage.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-233042.jpeg)

Visual uniformity plays an essential role in making iPad multitasking appear simple and devoid of additional clutter, and it suggests that Apple has been preparing for the increased complexity of iOS 9 for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised if bigger iPhones and the prospect of iPad multitasking ended up being key factors in the decision process of iOS 7 back in late 2012. Today's iPad multitasking wouldn't be possible without an OS that can scale and adapt depending on a user's task, screen size, language, or preferred device orientation. With the system that Apple has put in place - from San Francisco and the Retina display to the keyboard and extensions - every piece works together.

There is an added complexity to the overall iPad experience when using new multitasking features in iOS 9, but it's always mitigated by understandable constraints. Whether it's the two possible sizes for Split View or the magnetic behavior of Picture in Picture, the increased capabilities of iOS 9 on the iPad come with acceptable limitations. There are some instances of Apple trying to be too clever or redesigning features for reasons that aren't completely clear yet; for the most part, though, Apple has been judicious in its implementation of simultaneous apps and system features.

On paper, iPad multitasking can be visually complex. In practice, you're not going to always be dealing with overcrowded Split Views displaying multiple menus. iOS 9 multitasking strikes a great balance of optional power tools and the underlying simplicity that has characterized the iPad for the past five years.

I bet it's going to be even better [on a 13-inch device](https://www.macstories.net/news/ipad-pro-our-complete-overview/).

  2. The way the icons subtly fade as you swipe between apps, or how an adjacent card snaps to the right as you quit an app is well done. [↩](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/15/)
  


### The Utility of iPad Multitasking

My work for MacStories and Relay FM involves writing posts, doing research in Safari, taking notes, managing email, and communicating with others. I use a lot of apps every day, and while I try to automate tedious and repeating tasks as much as possible, there's always quite some switching required to jump from app to app, even after the extensibility brought by iOS 8.

iOS 9 has profoundly changed the way I work from my iPad. This has been true for Apple apps, as well as third-party ones I've been testing this summer.

I've come to use Apple's Notes app every day. Thanks to its built-in support for Slide Over and Split View, I'm using Notes as a persistent scratchpad next to Safari, Mail, and Messages. While the use case is the same as before - I'm taking notes or reading text from a note - the speed and the simplicity granted by multitasking are completely new. I've been able to read Apple's documentation for iOS 9 on one side of the screen and take notes at the same time with Notes in Split View; I can scroll my Twitter client, take a quick note with Slide Over, and later reopen that note while I'm talking to [Myke](https://mobile.twitter.com/imyke) so we can go through the thoughts I saved.

Notes and multitasking have also been phenomenal additions when testing new apps and updates for MacStories reviews. When I'm trying a new app, I can use multitasking to save first impressions about the interface and user experience. Later, when I have to send feedback to the developer, I can put Mail and Notes in Split View, copy and paste text, and I'm done.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-233325.jpeg)

The savings granted by iPad enhancements in iOS 9 may seem small as individual entities, but they add up over time. If I'm listening to an episode of Mac Power Users and I want to open show notes in the browser, I can just put Safari next to Podcasts, tap all the links I want to check out, and Split View will open those links in Safari on the right side.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-233522.jpeg)

If I'm researching a topic and I realize I need to visualize it with a mind map, I can fire up the excellent iThoughts, split the screen to have Safari next to it, and turn my iPad into a more proficient research tool that is both a mind map _and_ a browser at the same time.

In fact, this review has been entirely researched, composed, and edited on my iPad Air 2 thanks to iOS 9's new iPad features.

Soon after Apple seeded the first beta of iOS 9 to developers, I installed it on my iPad and started working on iOS 9 research. Since then, I only used a Mac twice for tasks related to the review that couldn't be done on iOS. First, I had to install the beta OS on my iPad and transfer WWDC session videos to the Videos app with iTunes.[35](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/16/) Then, I had to use El Capitan's Safari Web Inspector to measure performance of Content Blockers in iOS 9's Safari. These two occasions aside, OS X was never involved in any part of the writing or editing process on my end.

With Videos and Picture in Picture, I was able to play a WWDC session while looking up information in Safari and taking notes at the same time. With the new Shortcut Bar and cursor control gesture, formatting and editing text in a note (to fix typos, delete lines, or create headings) was quick and painless. If Picture in Picture was getting in the way, I could dock it to the side and hide it from view. For about two weeks, I only took notes, watched videos, took more notes, and copied and pasted links and images from Safari[36](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/16/) into Notes in Split View. I saved tweets about interesting iOS 9 features from Twitterrific into Notes with the share extension, too.

Then, when the time came to turn my notes into an outline with some kind of structure, I used a beta version of iThoughts to enter Split View so I could look at the notes and mind map side by side. This way, I was able to have my stream of notes on the right and paste them or rewrite them on the left in the mind map. iThoughts has fantastic shortcurts to create new nodes and sub-nodes with the Return and Space keys of the software keyboard, and that (combined with swiping) was a great way to create branches in seconds. If I needed to insert images in the mind map, I could use the built-in image picker or copy an image from Safari in Split View and paste it into the map. This went on for about a month.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-15-234451.jpeg)

When I started writing the actual review in mid-July, I used Slide Over extensively because Editorial - my text editor of choice - didn't support iOS 9 multitasking. This is the unsung benefit of Slide Over - it brings the convenience of iOS 9 multitasking to any app, regardless of their support for the more powerful Split View.

I've used everything in Slide Over while writing in Editorial. I used it to reply to iMessages without leaving Editorial so Myke and my girlfriend didn't think I was ignoring them (I was just _very_ focused). Safari, iThoughts, Photos, Notes, and Mail were excellent to look up my mind map and reference material while assembling chapters. Later on, as I got more betas with support for iOS 9 multitasking, I used apps such as [PCalc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-the-best-calculator/id284666222?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) for quick calculations in Slide Over, [Terminology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminology-3-extensible-dictionary/id687798859?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) to look up words in the dictionary (not even Apple has something like that), and [Dispatch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dispatch-email-meets-gtd-textexpander/id642022747?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) to instantly turn new email messages into tasks.

> _Safari is the perfect example for Slide Over._

Because of iOS 9 multitasking and enhancements to the iPad's software, for the first time this year I was able to produce a full review on iOS and be happy about it. Picture in Picture, Slide Over, Split View, and keyboard changes were great additions to my writing process, and their effects touched every area of my iPad workflow.

iOS 9 is a watershed moment for iPad users, and a game changer for the iPad platform. I've been using the iPad every day for the past three years, and iOS 9 brings a radical new way to work with apps on the device.

For a long time, I thought that I didn't want split screen multitasking on the iPad. I was afraid that such feature would make the iPad less focused - that eschewing the principle of one app at a time would result in the iPad losing its way. After using iOS 9, I can say that I was abundantly wrong.

![Working with Dispatch and Workflow in Split View.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-041422.jpeg)

> _Working with Dispatch and Workflow in Split View._

With iOS 9 multitasking, I feel more focused when working on my iPad because I'm switching between apps less. It sounds absurd, but it's not: because I no longer lose the context of what I'm doing by clicking the Home button, multiple apps aren't a distraction. I'm not focused on one app at a time anymore. I'm focused on a task. And if that involves multiple apps, the iPad can handle it.

With iOS 9, an app on the iPad no longer necessarily commands the entire screen. This makes the iPad more comparable to a traditional computer, with the screen being used not to mimic a single utility but as a canvas for software, in multiple shapes and forms.

The complexities created by the ability to manage concurrent apps have been largely kept at bay by Apple's design choices, which include limited compact sizes, selected corners for Picture in Picture, and, like extensions last year, a lack of tools to programmatically activate multitasking - meaning, you'll always have to touch the screen to initiate Slide Over and Split View.

iOS 9 multitasking's most evident pitfall is lack of drag & drop between apps in Split View. You would think that, given two apps side by side and a platform based on touch, Apple would have built a system to move information from one app to another. This isn't available yet, and it's my biggest wish for future iterations.

Other improvements I'd like to see in multitasking would be a faster way to flip the secondary and primary app in Split View, as well as support for external keyboard shortcuts in multitasking. Right now, there's no way to show Slide Over or manage Split View with an external keyboard, which slows me down when I don't want to touch the screen.

The inconsistencies of the classic app switcher and what's still missing don't change the underlying premise. iPad multitasking on iOS 9 transforms how the device can be used as a computer every day. I run MacStories entirely from my iPad, and multitasking has dramatically sped up how I work. But what Apple has done with iOS 9 on the iPad goes beyond multitasking alone.

For the first time since its launch in 2010, the iPad is ready to have its own unique OS. Apple's focus on familiarity and consistency with iPhone OS was a selling point of the iPad five years ago, but with time it became a liability.

For the past four years, iOS for iPad has mostly felt like a rushed adaptation of the main iOS for iPhone, with uninspired designs scaled up from the smaller screen. iOS 9 shows some progress on this front - such as a redesigned Notification Center with two widget columns - but it's possible to come across UIs that have been enlarged from the iPhone without proper consideration. However, the sheer amount of what's new and exclusive to the iPad in iOS 9 offsets what is left over from the previous era.

Today, we're seeing what iOS for iPad should be. A version of iOS that shares the same underlying technologies and design language of the iPhone, but optimized for the different hardware and interactions of the iPad. There's still work to be done, but what we have today is an impressive step up from iOS 8. With multitasking, keyboard changes, bigger folders, and Picture in Picture, all past mistakes are forgiven.

iOS 9 is the first version of iOS that isn't afraid to let the iPad be the iPad. Consistent with the iPhone, willing to take its own risks, and reminiscent of a Mac without the baggage of OS X.

With iOS 9, the iPad has entered adulthood.

## Search and Deep Linking

iOS 9 introduces a supercharged Spotlight that, under the umbrella of Search, aims to lay a new foundation for finding app content and connecting apps.

![iOS 9 Search: accessed by swiping down \(center\) or from a dedicated page \(right\).](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-015653.jpeg)

> _iOS 9 Search: accessed by swiping down (center) or from a dedicated page (right)._

iOS Search is accessed by swiping down on any Home screen (like the existing Spotlight) or as a standalone page to the leftmost side of the first Home screen in a return to form that does more than just search. When swiping down from the Home screen, the cursor is immediately placed in the search box, ready to type; if opened from the dedicated page, you'll have to tap the search box or swipe down to bring up the keyboard - an important difference geared at showcasing other features available in this screen. As far as searching is concerned, both modes lead to the same results.

On the surface, iOS 9 Search augments the existing Spotlight by extending its capabilities beyond launching apps and searching for data from [selected partners](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/spotlight/). With iOS 9, you'll be able to look for content from installed apps, such as documents from iCloud Drive, events from a calendar app, or direct messages from a Twitter client. This can be done by typing any query that may be relevant to the content's title and description; results display rich previews in iOS 9, optionally with buttons to interact with content directly from search.

iOS Search is more than a fancier Spotlight. Changes in this release include new APIs for local apps and the open web, highlighting Apple's interest in web search as an aid to apps. Some aspects of it aren't clear yet - and Apple has been tweaking quite a few things over the summer - but the nature of the change is deep and intriguing.

A key distinction to note in Apple's implementation of Search is that are two different indexes powering results that appear in Spotlight and Safari. A local, on-device index of private user content and data that is never shared with anyone or synced between devices; and a server-side, cloud index that is under Apple's control and fed by the company's [Applebot](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204683) web crawler.

### Local Search: CoreSpotlight and User Activities

In iOS 9.0, the focus is mostly on the local index, which will power the majority of queries on user devices.

iOS 9 can build an index of content, app features, and activities that users may want to get back to with a search query. It's comprised of two APIs: [CoreSpotlight](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreSpotlight/Reference/CoreSpotlight_Framework/), an index of user content built like a database that can be periodically updated in the background; and our friend [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUserActivity_Class/), this time employed to index user activities in an app as points of interest.

![Results from Maps and WhereTo have buttons to open directions.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-015957.jpeg)

> _Results from Maps and WhereTo have buttons to open directions._

From a user's perspective, it doesn't matter how an app indexes content - using the new search feature to find it always works the same way. Search results from apps in iOS 9 are displayed with the name of the app they're coming from, a title, description, an optional thumbnail image, and buttons for calling and getting directions if those results include phone numbers or addresses. Visually, there is no difference between results powered by CoreSpotlight and those based on user activities: both display rich previews in iOS 9 and can be tapped to open them directly into an app.

On a technical level, the difference between CoreSpotlight and NSUserActivity for developers is that while activities are intended to be added to the on-device index as the user views content in an app, CoreSpotlight entries can be updated and deleted in the background even if the user isn't doing anything in the app at the moment. For this reason, a todo app that uses sync between devices may want to adopt CoreSpotlight to maintain an index of up-to-date tasks: while entries in the index can't be synced, developers can update CoreSpotlight in the background, therefore having a way to check for changes in an app - in this example, modified tasks - and update available results accordingly.

Apple is also giving developers tools to set expiration dates for the CoreSpotlight index (so entries in the database can be purged after some time to prevent the archive from growing too large) and they can rely on iOS' existing background refresh APIs and combine them with CoreSpotlight background changes to keep the local index fresh and relevant.

Apple's own apps make use of both CoreSpotlight and NSUserActivity to build an on-device index of user content. Mail, Notes, Podcasts, Messages, Health, and others allow you to look for things you've either created, edited, organized, or seen before, such as individual notes and messages, but also the Heart Rate pane of the Health app or an episode available in Podcasts.

![Search results from Drafts and Dispatch.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-014540.jpeg)

> _Search results from Drafts and Dispatch._

I've also been able to try apps with support for local indexing on iOS 9. Drafts 4.5 enables you to search for text from any draft stored in the app. Clean Shaven Apps has added CoreSpotlight indexing support to Dispatch, allowing you to look for messages already stored in the inbox and a rolling archive of the latest messages from another mailbox. On iOS 9, iThoughts lets you search for _any_ node in a mind map and jump directly to it from search, bypassing the need to find a file in the app, open it, and find the section you're looking for.

WhereTo's iOS 9 update was perhaps the most impressive search-related update I tested: the app lets you search for categories of businesses nearby (such as restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets, etc.) as points of interest, but you can also get more detailed results for places you've marked as favorites, with a button to open directions in Maps from search with one tap.

Apple has given developers a fairly flexible system to index their app content, which, with a proper combination of multiple APIs, should allow users to find what they're expected to see in their apps.

However, this isn't all that Apple is doing to make iOS Search richer and more app-aware. Apple is building a server-side index of crawled web content that has a connection to apps - and that's where their plans get more confusing.

### Apple's Server-Side Index

In building iOS 9 Search, Apple realized that apps often have associated websites where content is either mirrored or shared. For the past several months, Apple has been crawling websites they deemed important to index their content with a crawler called Applebot; now, they're ready to let every website expose its information to Applebot via web markup. The goal is the same: to provide iOS Search with rich results - in this case culled from a much larger source.

The server-side index is a database in the cloud of public content indexed on the web. Unlike a traditional search engine like Google, though, Apple's primary motivation to keep a cloud index is to find web content that has an app counterpart, so users can easily view it in a native app.

Think of all the services that have native apps for content that is also available on the web: from music services to online publications and websites like Apple's online store or Foursquare, many of the apps we use every day are based on content that comes from the web and is experienced in an iOS app. From such perspective, Apple's goal is simple: what about content that can be viewed in an app but that hasn't been experienced _yet_ by the user? What about a great burger joint near me listed in Foursquare that I still haven't seen in the Foursquare _app_, or an article about Italian pasta that I haven't read in my favorite site's app yet?

Instead of having to search Google or use each app's search feature, Apple is hoping that the iOS Search page can become a universal starting point for finding popular content that can be also be opened in native apps.

Because the web is a big place, to understand the relationship between websites and apps Apple has started from an unexpected but obvious place: [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa). When they submit an app to the App Store, developers can provide URLs for marketing and support websites of an app; Apple can match those websites with the app in their index and crawl them with Applebot for content that could enrich Search. These pieces of content - such as listings from Airbnb or places in Foursquare - will then be available in the Search page and Safari (the browser's search feature can only search this type of content, as it doesn't support local app search) and will open in a native app or on the indexed webpage if the app isn't installed.

![How Applebot ](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-020255.jpeg)

> _How Applebot "sees" a MacStories article._

To teach Applebot how to crawl webpages for iOS Search and give results some structure, Apple has rolled out support for various web markup technologies. Developers who own websites with content related to an app will be able to use [Smart App Banners](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html), [App Links](http://applinks.org/), and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) to describe deep links to an app; the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) and [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) standards are used to provide metadata for additional result information.

Apple calls these "rich results". With schema.org, for instance, Applebot is able to recognize tagged prices, ratings, and currencies for individual listings on a webpage, while the Open Graph image tag can be used as an image thumbnail in search results. The goal is to make web-based results rich in presentation as their native counterparts. When you see rich descriptions and previews for links shared on Twitter, Facebook, or Slack, Open Graph and schema.org are usually behind them. Apple wants the same to be true for iOS search results. They've even put together a [search API testing tool for developers](https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool/) to see how Applebot crawls their webpages.

In practice, it's been nearly impossible for me to test the server-side index this summer. In my tests from June to early September, I was never able to consistently find results from popular online services (Airbnb, Foursquare, eBay, or Apple's own online store) that were relevant to my query or capable of enriching the native experience of an app on my device. In the majority of my tests, web results I managed to see in Search were either too generic, not relevant anymore, or simply not performing as advertised.

For example, when typing "Restaurants Rome Foursquare" without having the Foursquare app installed on my device, I got nothing in iOS Search. My assumption was that popular Foursquare results would be available as Applebot-crawled options in Search, but that wasn't the case. Same for Airbnb, except that I occasionally managed to see listings for apartments fetched from the web, but they weren't relevant to me (one time I typed "Airbnb Rome Prati", and I somehow ended up with an apartment in France. The result was nicely displayed in Search though, with a directions button for Maps).

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-014705.jpeg)

I've started seeing _some_ web results show up in iOS Search over the past couple of days under a 'Suggested Website' section. Starting Monday (September 14th), I began receiving results from the Apple online store, IMDb, and even MacStories. I searched for content such as "House of Cards", "iPad Air 2", and "MacStories iPad", and web-based results appeared in Search with titles, descriptions, and thumbnails. In all cases, tapping a result either took me to Safari or to the website's native app (such as the IMDb app for iOS 9 I had installed). Results in Search were relevant to my query, and they populated the list in a second when typing.

The issues I've had with web results in iOS 9 Search this summer and the late appearance of "suggested websites" earlier this week leads me to believe that server-side results are still rolling out.

The most notable example is that [Apple's own demonstration of web results in search](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016308), the Apple online store, isn't working as advertised in the company's technical documentation. The web results I saw didn't appear under a website's name in Search, but they were categorized under a general 'Suggested Website'. In Apple's example, Beats headphones should appear under an 'Apple Store' source as seen from the web, but they don't. My interpretation is that proper server-side results with rich previews are running behind schedule, and they'll be available soon.

A change in how NSUserActivity was meant to enhance web results adds further credence to this theory. As [I explored in my story from June](https://www.macstories.net/stories/inside-ios-9-search-apples-plan-for-more-connected-apps/), Apple announced the ability for developers to tag user activities in their apps as public to indicate public content that was engaged with by many users. According to Apple, they were going to build a crowdsourced database of public user activities, which could help Applebot better recognize popular webpages.

Here's how Apple [updated its documentation in August](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/tn2416/_index.html):

> Activities marked as eligibleForPublicIndexing are kept on the private on-device index in iOS 9.0, however, they may be eligible for crowd-sourcing to Apple's server-side index in a future release. 

Developers are still able to tag user activities as public. What is Apple doing with those entries, exactly? Another [document explains](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUserActivity_Class/):

> Identifying an activity as public confers an advantage when you also add web markup to the content on your related website. Specifically, when users engage with your app's public activities in search results, it indicates to Apple that public information on your website is popular, which can help increase your ranking and potentially lead to expanded indexing of your website's content. 

If this sounds confusing, you're not alone. To me, this points to one simple explanation: Apple has bigger plans for web results and the server-side index with a tighter integration between native apps (public activities) and webpages (Applebot), but something pushed them back to another release. The result today is an inconsistent mix of webpages populating Search, which, as far as web results alone are concerned, is far from offering the speed, precision, and dependability of Google or DuckDuckGo in a web browser.

There's lots of potential for a search engine that uses web results linked to native apps without any middlemen. If working as promised, iOS Search could become the easiest way to find _any_ popular content from the web and open it in a native app, which in turn could have huge consequences on app discoverability and traffic to traditional search engines - more than website suggestions in Safari have already done.

However, this isn't what iOS Search is today, and it's not fair to judge the feature based on the merit of its future potential. The server-side index is clearly not ready yet.

  


### The Flow of Search

Today, iOS 9 Search is useful to find content from installed apps. The ability to look for specific pieces of content and quickly get to them has been a major addition to my workflow and, if anything, the biggest hurdle in using Search has been _remembering_ that I can now look for everything on my devices. After years of being used to opening apps first and finding content second, it's hard to kick a habit entrenched in muscle memory.

For their own apps, Apple has done a good job at ensuring content found in Search is properly displayed and highlighted once opened in the relevant app. When you open a message from Search, the message bubble in the Messages app is darkened to indicate it's the selected result; a reminder opened from Search gets a bold title in the Reminders app; podcast episodes and Mail messages are also shown as selected items in the respective apps after you open them from Search. Part of this was already in place with iOS 8, and it's been extended to more apps with iOS 9.

As for third-party developers, it's up to them to figure out ways to restore their app's state when selecting search results, but most of the apps I tried with Search support - Dispatch, Drafts, iThoughts, and others - used similar techniques to update their UIs and restore results.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-020503.jpeg)

I'm still learning how to remember that I can now find information and documents more quickly thanks to Search. I've become a fan of the ability to look for songs and playlists in My Music and play them right away from Search - and I like how iOS adjusts the ranking of songs based on those I've been listening to recently. Searching for messages in Mail has been considerably faster and more accurate when done from Spotlight than the app's own search feature. I _love_ how the Podcasts app exposes show descriptions and notes to search, and I've grown accustomed to jumping to specific sections of the Health app and iThoughts via Search. I can't wait to see what apps like Slack, Dropbox, Editorial, and Pocket will do with Search and how that will speed up the way I move across apps and tasks.

My main concern with new data sources available for Spotlight is that Apple hasn't built more advanced controls to choose how app content ends up in there. In iOS 9, it's possible to turn off apps that populate results in Settings > General > Spotlight Search, but there's no way to reorder apps and make sure that, for instance, Mail results are always at the top. This, combined with the way iOS 9 dynamically ranks results based on engagement and puts some of them in a Top Hits section, has caused me some confusion from a spatial perspective, as results aren't always in the same position or in the same order.

Also, because indexing local app content can be a CPU-intensive task, background updates to the database may not be immediate (though this has been sporadic in my tests) and the search functionality of NSUserActivity and CoreSpotlight is not supported on the iPhone 4s, iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation). Developers will have to carefully consider how to index their app content to avoid consuming too many resources, but I'm optimistic the system will scale gracefully on latest hardware. Results on my iPad Air 2 come up almost instantly as I start typing a query, and they continue to update in real time as I add keywords.

Apple hasn't built a traditional document-based search feature in iOS 9. For the past two years, the company has been enhancing its Spotlight search tool with external integrations such as Wikipedia results, movie showtimes, and snippets of web results from Bing. iOS 9 expands that to account for the richness of data inside apps.

While users will be able to launch apps and look for documents in the traditional way, Search in iOS 9 is aware of the unique nature of apps, which may include activities, points of interest, sections of a document, and other subsets of content. In a post-PC world, it makes sense to have a new kind of search that focuses on what's inside apps rather than filenames alone.

Modern apps aren't static containers of files. They're rich _experiences_, and iOS 9 can index the activity that takes place inside them. App search in iOS 9 has lived up to my expectations. I'm waiting to see what Apple has in store for their server-side index.

  


## Deep Links, Back Links, Universal Links

Deep linking is where the pieces of Apple's app search and navigation puzzle come together. iOS 9 marks Apple's long awaited foray into native [deep linking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_deep_linking), and the company is betting heavily on deep links as a superior way to launch apps, navigate them, index content, and share results.

Deep linking refers to the ability to link to a specific location within an app. Deep links are [URIs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) that open apps into discrete navigation points, such as the Steps screen in the Health app, a profile view in Tweetbot, or an email message in Mail. With proper support from developers, any iOS app screen or activity can have its own deep link. Over the years, a [number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/applinks/ios) of third-party [companies](https://deeplink.me/) have [attempted](https://urx.com/) to establish cross-platform standards for deep links in apps; with iOS 9, Apple aims to provide deep linking support in _every_ app natively.

Deep links provide structure. With deep links, individual app sections and activities can be restored when a user opens a link to them from Search. They power smart reminders so Siri can create todos that contain a deep link to reopen an app's view. Smart App Banners, used by developers to match their websites to native apps, enable Applebot to associate web links with deep links and prioritize certain webpages over others when indexing webpages.

Under the hood, deep links lay a new foundation for launching and navigating apps on iOS. This starts from the app launching animation itself: alongside a revised multitasking switcher, iOS 9 features a new transition for going from one app to the other that pushes the current app to the left and slides onto a new one to the right.

Thanks to this, opening apps on iOS feels more like navigating pages of the OS - a metaphor that reinforces the idea of deep links capable of connecting specific sections of apps together. The animation feels faster than iOS 8 and it makes sense within the spatiality of iOS 9.

The new app launching animation does more than offering new visual eye candy - it showcases iOS 9's deep linking capabilities in the status bar. New in iOS 9, every time you'll leave an app to open another one by following a link or a notification, you'll get a back button in the upper left corner of the status bar to go back to the "launcher" app.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-020647.jpeg)

The back button has long been a staple of Android devices; at least initially, it was surprising to see Apple follow a similar approach for iOS 9. The similarities with [Android's back navigation](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/temporal.html) feature are only superficial: iOS' back button is built into the status bar and it offers a shortcut to return to the app that launched the one you're in; it's overridden every time an app launches another one. If you open a link from Messages into Safari, the status bar will show a back button to return to Messages; if you tap a notification when in Safari and open Twitter, the back button will only return you to Safari.

iOS 9's back button doesn't go back into the entire navigation stack of recent apps. It sticks to the status bar even if you move around an app, but it'll disappear after two minutes. It's not a persistent back button - it's a temporary shortcut.

The back button is useful when combined with deep links that open apps into specific views. When used from Search, the back button makes it easy to view a result, go back to Search with one tap, pick another, and so forth. It also makes tapping notifications less disruptive to the user experience, as returning to what you were doing is one tap away. With it, the role of the Home button is considerably diminished in iOS 9, as returning to the previous app is easier and more contextual.

The placement of the back button is problematic. When following a link or a notification into another app, the button will be displayed in the left corner of the status bar, hiding Wi-Fi and carrier information - an essential detail that tells us how our devices are connecting to the Internet. On more than one occasion, I found myself following links and wondering why an app wasn't loading - I couldn't tell if the app was having problems, or if my 4G network had poor reception because the back button was covering up everything. I wish Apple had thought of a gesture to manually dismiss the back button; on the iPad, they could have at least placed it next to Wi-Fi and carrier information given the bigger display.

I sympathize with the struggle to find a placement for this button. Ultimately, an OS with superior deep linking features benefits from a system-wide shortcut that lets users navigate back and forth between apps as they would with webpages, and that corner of the status bar is the least intrusive option. It's not perfect but it could have been worse; in practice, it's useful and consistent.

Apple's plans for deep linking extend beyond search, smart reminders, and the back button. With iOS 9 Apple is introducing Universal Links, a way to launch and link to apps with web links. With Universal Links, Apple is letting websites and apps communicate through the common thread of a URL, with verifiable ownership, graceful fallbacks, and cross-platform support.

![A Universal Link opened from Safari \(back button\) in MeisterTask.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-014105.jpeg)

> _A Universal Link opened from Safari (back button) in MeisterTask._

Universal Links are meant to offer a superior option to custom URL schemes for launching apps and sharing links to them. A Universal Link is a web link that, with a file uploaded by developers on their app's servers and integration in Xcode, iOS 9 can open into a native app instead of its website. Upon first launching an app with Universal Links support in iOS 9, the app will check for the configuration file on its server; from that point on, whenever possible, HTTP links to that domain will open in the app, showing the deep linked view.

To understand how Universal Links work, imagine that Twitter will start supporting them for twitter.com URLs and their iOS app. Every time you tap a link to a tweet on iOS 9, that link will open the tweet in the native app instead of Safari if you have it installed. If you don't have the app or share the link with someone who doesn't have the app, the link will open in the browser as a fallback because it's a normal URL.

Imagine this for links to shared projects in a todo app, songs on a streaming service, Slack uploads, Overcast podcast episodes, or Google Docs files. With a regular HTTP link, iOS 9 will take you to the content you're looking for inside a native app. Universal Links are platform neutral: if the app isn't installed, they go straight to the web anyway.

![The flow of a Universal Link from Google to IMDb's app and webpage.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-020755.jpeg)

> _The flow of a Universal Link from Google to IMDb's app and webpage._

When writing this review, I was able to test a version of IMDb with Universal Links. When opened from Safari, Google, Search, and any other app, imdb.com links automatically opened in the native IMDb app, showing me the content - such as trailers or movie pages - I would have seen on the web by default in iOS 8.

Universal Links are meant to provide a safe, cross-platform way to share links to content in apps without relying on custom URL schemes. Instead of linking to a user profile in Twitter with the custom `'twitter://` URL scheme, you'll be using the same twitter.com links you see in the browser every day. With a custom URL scheme, if you don't have the app installed and tap the URL, it does nothing. URL schemes are local; Universal Links are global _and_ local at the same time.

Universal Links carry important benefits over the old way to link to specific areas or features of apps. Universal Links are _always_ mapped to the right app: while different apps can claim the same URL scheme on iOS, Universal Links work by matching an app with a JSON file on the app's server; this ensures that links from a certain domain can only open in its associated app. In Twitter's case, this could mean that, if installed, twitter.com links will always launch the official Twitter app, and [The Iconfactory](http://twitterrific.com/ios) and [Tapbots](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) won't be able to do anything about it as they can't control the twitter.com server.

It was obvious for Apple to elect web URLs as the best way to link to apps: web links are omnipresent in today's communications, they work everywhere, and they are the common language of the web.

Universal Links are designed to not be noticed and to feel as seamless as possible. For the most part, that's exactly what using them is like - you tap a link and, if it's a Universal one, it'll open in an app.

There are some aspects of the process that you can control. When opening a Universal Link, iOS 9 will display a forward button on the right side of the status bar (opposite to the back button) to give you the option to view the link in Safari instead. The same issues mentioned for the back button apply here as well, as the shortcut takes over battery and Bluetooth icons (and looks comically alone on the iPad). However, the ability to jump from native app to webpage with one tap is convenient, and I couldn't imagine any other place for it.

If you choose to view a Universal Link in the browser, a banner will sit atop the webpage with an Open button to return to the native app if you change your mind. This is the equivalent of a small Smart App banner, but it's not as obtrusive. It's a nice idea, and it lets you cycle through native app and web view for a Universal Link with one tap.

All together, iOS 9's new deep linking features make for a unified app experience built with speed, security, and consistency in mind. They're also signs of a mature OS and app ecosystem that are ready to talk to each other with links that connect app content to system features, eschewing the numerous hacks and workarounds of custom URL schemes.

Going back to iOS 8's app switching design and limitations feels cumbersome after trying iOS 9. Deep links and Universal Links dramatically speed up moving between apps - and they reduce the Home button to a mere hardware option for going back to the Home screen. The back button, while not perfect and perhaps a bit inelegant at times (reaching it also requires a certain dexterity), is a great shortcut, and I can't imagine using iOS without it now. I wasn't able to try many apps with Universal Links support, and, while I believe they won't be suitable for apps that don't rely on web content, I believe they offer a superior option to URL schemes in every way.

iOS apps are starting to feel less and less like silos. Aided by the back button, deep links and Universal Links are another step towards more interconnected apps.

  


## Intelligence

For many of us, iOS devices are the most important computers in our lives. With iOS 9, Apple is rolling out a series of features for proactive recommendations and intelligent suggestions aimed at making the devices we use every day smarter, more contextual, and personal. The results are mixed, but the beginning of something new is afoot.

The source of all of iOS 9's proactive and intelligent features is our data and daily routine. By using information we store in system apps such as Mail and Calendar and by observing our habits, iOS 9 can discover patterns in the apps we use, when and where we tend to use them, and it can offer shortcuts to show us what we're most likely going to need next. In broad strokes, this is at the core of Apple's proactive initiative: by learning from our habits and data, iOS can be a more helpful assistant in everyday life. Unlike similar efforts by other companies (namely [Google](https://www.google.com/landing/now/)), Apple has prioritized user privacy when building these functionalities into iOS 9, a design choice with a deep impact on what the OS is capable of suggesting.

Intelligent and proactive recommendations are scattered throughout iOS 9 with shortcuts in various places. Some of them are labeled as Siri features, while others are new options in existing apps that use content from _other_ apps to save time with suggestions.

As a starting point, the new Search page features Siri suggestions for contacts and apps. Displayed at the top of the page and replacing the old contact shortcuts of the iOS 8 app switcher, these shortcuts aren't indicative of contacts explicitly marked as favorites or apps you've recently used. Rather, these suggestions are based on what iOS thinks you're going to need.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-040117.jpeg)

Recommendations are informed by different variables, such as frequency of use, time of the day, day of the week, current location, and other patterns the OS spots and that are used to build up suggestions for apps and people. There's a chance you'll see an app you only use on Thursdays and friends you only contact during the weekend. One time, I got a suggestion for my Shopping list in Reminders, and I later realized it was because I was at the grocery store and iOS had memorized the list I frequently used when shopping there.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-030353.jpeg)

I also saw a recommendation for this review's EPUB in iBooks (with a read completion status) when I was assembling the eBook and constantly checking it out in the app.

When working as advertised, Siri suggestions are handy because they bring serendipitous discovery to the Search page. And because they're not a static set of favorites but a dynamic, continuously updating list of shortcuts that learn from you, they adjust alongside your routine and what you're likely to do next.

For example, I use the [Do Button](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/do-button-by-ifttt/id905998610?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) app every night before sleep to tell my girlfriend the exact time I went to bed with an email. Now, iOS 9's Search page shows me a shortcut to that app every night between 3 and 5 AM, when I typically go to bed. I've seen suggestions for Google Maps at specific places where iOS knew I was going to start navigation in the app, and a couple of friends pop up on Saturdays because I tend to text them and ask them to go out for dinner (when tapping a contact, iOS displays phone, message, and FaceTime actions for it). iOS 9 has picked up some of my habits, and when I come across a suggestion that is accurate, I'm glad iOS is helping me save time.

That's not always the case, though. The patterns that I described above are fairly easy to spot as they're repeatable, discrete routines that stand out from everything else. But I use my iOS devices all day every day, and I switch between apps and conversations a lot. The average result is that, for me, Siri suggestions in the Search page mostly are a random selection of shortcuts with the occasional gem that appears at regular intervals when needed. That's the problem with a general purpose suggestion feature based on "patterns": when you use your iOS device too much (as I do), app and contact suggestions tend to feel like a lottery. They can't spot too many distinguishable patterns just by looking at which apps I launch.

Apps like Slack, Twitterrific, and Twitter are always listed in my Search page, but that's because I always use them. When I don't see Twitter and Slack, I see a repeat of apps I've recently used - the same entries from the app switcher. Do these make sense as persistent suggestions intermixed with shortcuts based on specific times of the day and locations? Wouldn't it be better to identify the apps I'm constantly using and display them in some kind of separate Top Hits view? _Of course_ I know I'm going to be reading Twitter and Slack. There's no point in iOS telling me to do so.

Another issue, I believe, is that Siri suggestions in this screen don't have any explanation attached to them. iOS 9 doesn't say "Good morning, here's what happened in Slack last night and I think you're going to need [CityMapper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/citymapper-ultimate-real-time/id469463298?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) next because you take the subway on Tuesdays"; it just brings up a bunch of shortcuts, leaving it up to you to figure out if they're useful or not. Sometimes, they are, and it feels nice. Most of the time, they are too generic to warrant a top spot in the Search page, and I think of turning them off entirely. I haven't yet because I've seen how they can be useful at times, but I'd like them to be more than recently used apps.

Along the same lines, the Search page offers shortcuts for Nearby businesses in Maps. Besides the fact that, for my area in Rome, Apple's business database continues to be outdated and lackluster, I don't understand the kind of Maps suggestions iOS gives me.

I would expect these recommendations to account for my habits (as tracked by iOS' Frequent Locations feature) and likelihood of needs to show me businesses relevant to my routine and time of the day. Instead, iOS' Nearby section has shown me all sorts of business suggestions at the most disparate times: convenience stores at 9 PM alongside "Nightlife" POIs[37](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/20/); coffee shops and restaurants at 3 AM[38](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/20/); "Fun" and "Transport" suggestions in the afternoon, which usually don't go well together.

In three months, I have never found the Nearby suggestions in the Search page to be useful. The categories are too broad for me to understand at a glance whether the place I'm looking for is "Fun" or "Nightlife", and the time of the day when they are displayed is usually not in line with what I do on a daily basis. I would prefer iOS to provide me with practical advice for individual places I frequently visit, such as the current traffic to get to my neighborhood supermarket or weather conditions at my favorite beach. Alas, this kind of detail and personalization isn't available for Nearby suggestions, and that's disappointing.

The other system-wide proactive mechanism of iOS 9 is standalone app recommendations. In this case, iOS will suggest an app to launch in the same area where Handoff for apps is displayed in the Lock screen (bottom left) and app switcher (at the bottom in iOS 9).

![App suggestions can be displayed in the Lock screen \(left\), or in Handoff.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-033556.jpeg)

> _App suggestions can be displayed in the Lock screen (left), or in Handoff._

These shortcuts are, like the Search page, accounting for different variables to recommend an app you're likely going to need. Because of their placement in the UI, they can be more easily noticed when your device enters a scenario that iOS identifies as a pattern.

In addition to time of the day and location, iOS 9 can monitor Bluetooth and audio connections and guess which app you may need when that happens. If you tend to open the Music app after plugging in your EarPods, iOS will bring up the Music icon and media controls in the Lock screen, or it'll display a shortcut in the app switcher telling you that you can open Music because an audio connection has been detected (I like how these suggestions come with an explanation). Or, if you like to watch Netflix with your Beats Wireless on, iOS will also spot that pattern and recommend Netflix as soon as a Bluetooth connection is established.

![Handoff has a new location in iOS 9.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-030559.jpeg)

> _Handoff has a new location in iOS 9._

The same variable can lead to different recommendations in different times of the day. Listen to audiobooks on your way to work in the morning but to podcasts when going back home? iOS 9 will show different apps for those two scenarios, learning and adjusting over time.

Apple also added contextual awareness support for getting in and out of the car in iOS 9, combining that with proactive suggestions. This isn't well documented by Apple, but as seen with Reminders, iOS 9 has the ability to recognize user presence in a car by looking at connections to generic car Bluetooth devices as well as CarPlay. The car becomes another dimension for smart suggestions in iOS 9, which can give you app shortcuts based on what you do - such as listening to podcasts or music when driving - but also traffic notifications for where you're most likely going. The idea of using the car as another layer of user patterns is an intriguing one, and while I couldn't test this because I don't have Bluetooth in my car, impressions from hundreds of users I polled on Twitter were positive.

I find individual app suggestions to be nice, and generally more timely and relevant than what I see on the Search page. While not revolutionary, it's nice to be able to quickly open Music or Overcast when my Beats are connected via Bluetooth, and I've been surprised by how iOS picked up that I was going to need Google Maps or [Nuzzel](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nuzzel-daily-news-from-your/id692285770?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline) at specific times of the day, putting them on the Lock screen. As more and more sensors fill our homes and clothes going forward, I fully expect iOS to gain support for deeper context recognition - imagine suggestions powered by HomeKit devices, proximity to an Apple TV, or [beacons](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/).

That's not to say that app suggestions in the Lock screen and app switcher are perfect: I'd still like to see more targeted suggestions for Music, as iOS hasn't figured out that I like to listen to [Death Cab for Cutie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plans_\(album\)) every night before bed. The granularity and timeliness granted by audio and Bluetooth connections have led to more useful app suggestions in my experience, but they can improve.

Next up is Mail, which is used in iOS 9 as an information database in three ways. In Contacts, you can search for people found in Mail and add them as new contacts with some fields already filled-in, or you can add new email addresses to an existing contact as iOS will match the same person between Contacts and Mail. This has been useful to update old contacts with new email addresses from my own correspondence.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-034618.jpeg)

Secondly, when receiving a phone call from a number that's not in your contacts (we all dread those phone calls), iOS 9 tries to discover who it is by looking into Mail messages. I only had that happen once, but it worked as expected.

Last, iOS is more proactive in offering to create new calendar events or contacts from messages that contain such information. A new banner displayed at the top of a message provides a shortcut to create new events and address book entries with one tap, which is a more visible option than iOS' existing support for [smart data detectors](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSDataDetector_Class/) in message bodies. iOS 9 can also detect events from messages that contain flight details or restaurant reservations and put them in Calendar for your consideration; you can choose to turn off event suggestions based on Mail in Settings.

Using Mail as a repository of information for other apps is an interesting idea: despite its somewhat archaic nature, a lot of our communications and notifications still come through email, and scanning Mail to bring up shortcuts and suggestions seems like a good idea to me (and I would like to see more of it). If anything, these features highlight the benefit of using Apple's native Mail and Calendar apps over third-party clients, which will get none of these integrations. I wouldn't be surprised to see users keeping Mail fetching messages in the background without using it just to take advantage of suggestions.

iOS 9's proactive suggestions for Contacts and Calendars don't stop at Mail. When I was on vacation with my girlfriend, we used Apple Maps in [Positano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positano) to browse restaurants nearby and call them to make a reservation. I didn't have their phone numbers in my address book, but I noticed that iOS 9 used the restaurant's name (taken from Yelp, I'd guess) in the Recent Calls screen, which was a nice touch.

In Calendar, events that contain an address now offer the option to use a Time to Leave notification that will send an alert when it's time to leave for an event depending on your current location and traffic. When receiving the notification, you can snooze it for later or tap it to see directions and get going.

![At 2 AM, it takes me 5 minutes to get there, not 16.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-034708.jpeg)

> _At 2 AM, it takes me 5 minutes to get there, not 16._

This is another interesting idea, but it hasn't worked well for me in practice. Events that I knew would take me 10 minutes to get to a location consistently sent Time to Leave notifications 25-40 minutes ahead of time. Not even after "teaching" the system that my driving style and traffic weren't as imagined by its intelligence did iOS learn that there was no need to send a notification 40 minutes early. I've wondered if the wiggle room between the notification and event time could be cultural: perhaps Americans like to arrive early at their events and don't mind waiting 20 minutes while sipping on their [ventis](http://blog.dictionary.com/starbucks-trenta/). But in Rome, there's no such thing as arriving early or spending 20 precious minutes to wait for someone else. Time to Leave is a cool idea, not suited for my habits and local traffic.

There are more intelligent and proactive features throughout the Search page and the OS, but I've found their realization to either be dull or their impact to be minimal. You can ask Siri to bring up photos from specific time period and albums. The Search page has a News section at the bottom, which, as a European using an iOS device with a US region format, I found to be an unappealing mix of news about presidential elections, football, and TV spoilers; in theory, iOS should be able to display news relevant to my location, but given that they've always been American-heavy topics, I imagine iOS is basing its news collection skills on the user's region format. You can also ask for weather, calculations, and sports results in the Search page, but only calculations and unit conversions worked for me (I'd call them an expected utility more than an intelligent feature).

Our devices are becoming smarter and more context-aware every year, but Apple's foray into intelligence and proactive suggestions doesn't substantially alter the user experience of an iOS device. Instead, what Apple has put together is a mix of sometimes-working, nice-to-have additions that feel unfinished or that are poorly realized. Suggestions in the Search page leave much to be desired, with useful patterns that are obfuscated by generic and unmotivated shortcuts. Standalone app recommendations based on location and audio connections and Mail's intelligent scanning is where Apple's vision feels clear and coherent, with delightful discoveries that can save some time every day.

If you're accustomed to the level of automated intelligence in Google services such as Google Now and Inbox, iOS 9 won't offer that kind of experience. The Search page is far from the uncanny precision of Google Now when plugged into all of your Google data, and Mail's new shortcuts pale in comparison to the automated processing and organization tools found in Inbox.

This is by design: while Google can pull it off thanks to their expertise and investment in looking at patterns across all of your data (which happens to be their business model), Apple has decided to prioritize user privacy as much as possible. That's why proactive suggestions are (mostly) processed directly on-device, with Apple never syncing any of your usage patterns between devices or matching data from one Apple service to the other to build a more complete profile of you.

It comes down to personal preference and the level of potential creepiness you allow in your computing life. Google tends to deliver impressive intelligent features and shortcuts, at the expense of a wealth of data given in return. Apple's efforts in iOS 9 are more modest in scale, but deeply integrated with the OS and built with privacy in mind.

It's not about arguing who's better; it's about choosing what works better _for you_. Are you comfortable with Google's impressive intelligence and suggestion tools knowing that they need as much data about you to power them, or do you prefer Apple's more private but also less effective approach?

My stance on these issues has changed a lot [since two years ago](https://www.macstories.net/stories/leaving-google-chrome-why-ive-returned-to-safari/), especially after trying Inbox, Google Now, and having to go back to Google Apps' Gmail due to slow IMAP sync and search. While I conceptually don't like the fact that my data is being used by an army of algorithms, the service I get in return is useful and it lets me work faster every day. When it comes to faster work, measurable efficiency trumps ideological stances. As an Italian movie once said, [you can't buy groceries with ideals](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NAYmAMmwzhU).

In Google's Inbox, search is crazy fast, the app detects sentences that look like reminders, and it categorizes emails for me. When I was in San Francisco earlier this year, the Google app automatically pulled in my flight and hotel information from Gmail, displayed it with handy cards in the main view, and it figured out when I arrived at [SFO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport) and showed me weather reports and currency exchange rates.

That was pretty amazing _and_ useful, and it's not something that iOS 9's intelligence is able to provide just yet. And I have to wonder if it ever will, given that what Google does - the depth of its user tracking and cross-service integration - could only be possible with constant, cloud-based data collection that doesn't fit with today's Apple.

Imagine, though, if Apple was willing to look for patterns _inside_ apps, understanding what we write in private communications and what we search for to spot more useful patterns than app launches and EarPods connections. [Would they have the skills](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/07/us-apple-machinelearning-idUSKCN0R71H020150907) required to build such intelligence? Would they want to?

Ultimately, it's not fair to compare iOS 9's intelligence to Google services: Google will never have this kind of access to device hardware and daily user patterns. iOS 9 delivers on small, periodic proactive enhancements that are meant to save time and surprise users. Their impact is not dramatic: some of them are nice shortcuts, but by not deeply aggregating user data from multiple sources, most of them are generic and stale.

Caught between the tension of respecting user privacy and deepening data collection for proactive features, will Apple be able to ship more useful suggestions in the future? And how will they build it all?

There's a lot of work to do. It's up to Apple to figure out what their ideals can allow.




## Performance and Low Power Mode

Everyone struggles with battery life. Talk to any iPhone owner, and you'll never hear them wish for shorter battery life on their device. There's no such thing as enough battery. With iOS 9, Apple is taking some steps toward improving battery life on all devices, with particular attention to the iPhone.

Across the entire OS, Apple claims to have optimized apps and key technologies to be more efficient and consume less energy. On top of this, iOS 9 can use the iPhone's proximity and ambient light sensors to detect when it's lying facedown on a surface, and it won't turn on the screen when a notification comes in. By itself, this sounds like a small change, but if you receive a lot of notifications every day, every drop counts.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-034145.jpeg)

Apple has increased the information displayed for battery usage, too. In the new Settings > Battery page, the list of apps and system functions consuming energy on your device includes some new entries (such as energy consumed by recently deleted apps) as well as additional detail that can be displayed by tapping the list of apps or the clock icon in the top right. This will list the minutes spent by apps in the foreground and background for the selected time range, which makes it easier to assess the consumption of an app depending on actual usage. More importantly, it simplifies the process of determining whether keeping background app refresh turned on for an app that consumes a lot of energy is worth it.

The protagonist of Apple's battery life improvements is Low Power Mode. Available exclusively on the iPhone, Low Power Mode temporarily reduces power consumption by reducing or turning off Mail fetch, background app refresh, automatic downloads, and "some visual effects". CPU and GPU performance may also be reduced, and Auto-Lock in 30 seconds is also enforced. When Low Power Mode is active, the iPhone's battery icon turns yellow, and the battery percentage is displayed even if you normally keep it off.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2015-09-16-051024.jpeg)

Low Power Mode can be activated in two ways. If you want to activate it manually, you can go into Settings > Battery and toggle it. There's (almost) nothing stopping you from running your device in Low Power Mode all the time. The most effective way to activate Low Power Mode, though, is to wait for your device to reach 20% or 10% of battery left: when that happens, an alert will allow you to turn on Low Power Mode and start saving on energy until you can charge your iPhone.

Low Power Mode isn't some kind of placebo effect. During the iOS 9 beta period, I activated Low Power Mode every time my iPhone 6 Plus reached 20% of battery left, and I noticed how it gave it a few extra minutes (about 30 in my experience) I could use to get home via Maps navigation or to go back to my car and charge it.

Surprisingly enough, Apple has thought about the possibility of users keeping Low Power Mode always on, and to discourage such usage - which could lead to an inferior user experience when there's no need to - iOS turns it off automatically once an iPhone reaches ~80% of charge (Apple calls it a "sufficient level"). This won't make it impossible to use an iPhone in Low Power Mode even if it's not running short of battery, but it should be a deterrent.

In practice, I didn't really notice any major functional difference when Low Power Mode was on. The "visual effects" that iOS 9 turns off are the animations of Dynamic Wallpapers and the parallax effect in Perspective Zoom, both of which I don't use and that therefore don't impact the visual appearance of my iPhone when they're disabled. If other effects are reduced, I can't notice: translucencies and other zoom animations are still available in Low Power Mode, so it's not like iOS turns into a static, opaque mix of colors when Low Power Mode is enabled. As Apple states, background app refresh and Mail message fetch are also disabled in this mode - a fair trade-off when battery life is at stake. For the most part, Low Power Mode is unobtrusive and it yields the results promised by Apple.

What's going to be interesting, I think, is how third-party apps will react to Low Power Mode to reduce their own energy consumption. iOS 9 adds a new Foundation API with a `lowPowerModeEnabled` property of NSProcessInfo that changes its state when Low Power Mode is enabled. Developers can also listen for a `NSProcessInfoPowerStateDidChangeNotification` notification that, as the name implies, informs an app on the state of Low Power Mode. Apple is advising developers to check the state of Low Power Mode in their apps, reducing costly computations such as frequent network activity and high frame rates to save energy.

In Breslan's case, his app Departure Board could support Low Power Mode by decreasing the usage of an API that checks for train departures every minute, allowing an iPhone to consume less energy by pinging a server less frequently. I tested a few apps with Low Power Mode integration in iOS 9: the email client Dispatch, for instance, is going to disable CoreSpotlight indexing and profile pictures in Low Power Mode to prevent an iPhone from indexing new messages in the inbox and fetching avatars from the Internet.

Max Litteral's [Television Time](http://maximilianlitteral.com/TelevisionTime/index.html), a TV show tracker, takes similar measures to reduce CPU consumption when the user enables Low Power Mode: the app will stop animations when loading images into table view cells, it'll disable downloading and animating thumbnails in search results, and it'll also disable face detection on show posters. Litteral is looking into disabling show sync in Low Power Mode as well, which would further reduce energy consumption by stopping network activity.

The work that Apple has done at a system level to prolong battery life with more efficient apps and Low Power Mode should already be enough to give most users a few minutes of extra battery. But in an ideal world, additional savings could be granted by third-party developers being good platform citizens and supporting Low Power Mode by adjusting their apps' behavior to consume less energy whenever possible.

Perplexingly, Low Power Mode isn't available on the iPad - a missing feature in stark contrast with the iPad focus of iOS 9. I don't understand what pushed Apple to make Low Power Mode an iPhone-only perk of iOS 9, and I'd like to see it coming to the iPad as soon as possible. Even if not as essential as an iPhone for emergency scenarios, Low Power Mode could be useful for iPad users looking for some extra minutes of battery life every day.

The last two major versions of iOS have been riddled with bugs and performance issues in their first releases, and it's good to see Apple prioritizing efficiency, storage, and stability this year. In addition to battery-themed enhancements, iOS 9 introduces smaller software updates for consumers (which I couldn't measure with developer betas), an option to install iOS updates at a later stage, and [App Thinning](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/watchos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html), a set of optimization tools (slicing, bitcode, and on-demand resources) to decrease the footprint of apps by delivering only the resources needed by a user's device. I couldn't test App Thinning either, but I expect it to have major implications for the future of local device storage, App Store downloads, and gaming content.

Stability-wise, iOS 9 is a step up from iOS 8. In my experience, I have seen only a couple of Home screen crashes and random reboots in three months of iOS 9 betas (down from at least twice a week, both on the iPhone and iPad), fewer interface glitches, and increased stability on the iPad Air 2 with Apple apps, using the app switcher, and extensions. New multitasking features on the iPad Air 2 have been rock solid, with a smooth Slide Over, stable Split View, and flawless Picture in Picture.

Unfortunately, memory pressure continues to be an issue on the iPhone 6 Plus, which can still lag in terms of frame rate compared to the Air 2 and that often purges apps from memory to free up resources for the current app. On the 6 Plus, I'm still seeing Safari frequently reload tabs after switching to another app, a slower than usual Camera, and slightly delayed touch responses when moving between apps.

Apple's house cleaning in iOS 9 offers a superior experience than older versions of iOS - at least on recent hardware - and it removes much of the cruft that had accumulated over the past two years. The real effect of features such as App Thinning and Low Power Mode for apps will only be seen in the next few months if developers opt into them, and it's intriguing to imagine a future where they'll be the norm.

  


## Everything Else and What I Couldn't Test

There are _dozens_ of other features in iOS 9 that, either in Apple apps or developer APIs, make iOS devices fast and more efficient. A few highlights:

**Updated setup process**. By default, iOS 9 prompts users to create a complex (6-digit) passcode when setting up a device for the first time. Other passcode types (such as 4-digit numeric code) are still available by tapping an options button. iOS 9's setup also features a new option to move data from an Android device with a dedicated Android app made by Apple.

**Notification quick replies for third-party apps**. In iOS 9, apps can implement quick replies in actionable notifications. Introduced with Messages last year, Apple has opened up the API to developers this year, allowing them to mix custom buttons with a text field to type a reply inside the notification without opening the app. I tested this feature with beta versions of Twitter clients and other apps, and it's incredibly convenient. I expect all messenger-type apps to adopt this.

**Trust developer certificates**. Installing beta versions of third-party apps from outside TestFlight gets a little more convoluted (but also more secure) in iOS 9 with a new system that requires you to manually trust enterprise developer certificate. To do so, you'll need to go into Settings > General > Profiles > Enterprise Apps and select an installed app you can trust; otherwise, it won't launch.

**Safari can save PDF to iBooks**. In iOS 9, you no longer need a third-party app to save a webpage as PDF. A new iBooks share extension lets you to save any webpage as a PDF document into the app - perfect for reading articles later or sharing PDFs via email and annotating them with Markup.

**Wi-Fi Assist**. Available in Settings > Cellular Data, this new toggle allows an iOS device to use its mobile network when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor. A lot of people have welcome this option, but I prefer to keep it turned off as I like to know exactly which network I'm using, and the automatic switch between cellular and Wi-Fi is not clear in the UI.

**ReplayKit for recording gameplay**. For the first time, Apple is offering game developers an API to natively record gameplay without using a third-party SDK. ReplayKit can be initiated automatically by an app as the user is playing, or it can be started manually. Apps can ask users to record the screen only or also access the microphone to include game commentary. A video file generated with ReplayKit is then passed to the system share sheet in-app, so users can save it to the Photos app, send it to other apps, or share it on social networks. With ReplayKit, creating _Let's Plays_ and video reviews for iOS games should be easier and better integrated with the system.

**Shared Links extensions**. Apps in iOS 9 can plug into Safari's Shared Links section to give users the ability to view links alongside RSS and Twitter links already supported in the browser. I suspect that news readers, social apps, and RSS apps will consider this extension type to make their items available outside in Safari, but I haven't been able to test any of them yet.

**Maps Nearby and route delays**. In addition to public transit information, Maps for iOS 9 features Nearby categories (a more complete section of the same options in Search) to browse businesses nearby and explore places around you. Also, during navigation, Maps will show banners at the top of the screen for upcoming closed roads, roadwork, and faster routes.

**Swipe down to dismiss photo previews**. In iOS 9, swiping down when viewing a photo in Photos or Messages lets you close the preview instead of reaching out to the Done button at the top of the screen. Another example of a sloppy gesture that simplifies interaction and that cuts down the number of taps required to operate the OS. I'm using this every day now.

**iPad Today view gets bigger**. The Today view of the iPad in landscape mode has received a new two-column layout split in Today view and Widgets view. Widgets can still be added as before, but now you can choose to display them with a bigger column on the left (Today) or in a narrow column on the right. This brings a better visual organization of widgets without any functional difference between the two columns, and it takes advantage of the bigger screen to show more widgets at the same time. I'm looking forward to trying this improved layout on the iPad Pro.

**New widgets**. Speaking of the Today view, iOS 9 adds new widgets for Find my Friends and to glance at the battery level of connected Bluetooth accessories as well as the device itself. The new 'Batteries' widget is automatically installed once you pair an Apple Watch with your iPhone - and it's been a convenient way to check on my Watch battery level directly from my iPhone. Plus, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and even Beats wireless headphones get nice icons to complement the widget's appearance.

**Spotlight unit conversions and calculations**. The improved Spotlight of iOS 9 goes beyond Search and it borrows from OS X to let you perform quick calculations and unit conversions. You can convert currencies (type or dictate "10 USD to EUR"), perform operations (also with values such as "pi"), convert temperatures, and more. I've been using this regularly, and it reduces the number of apps I have to keep on my devices for basic conversions and operations.

**Apple Music gets a new contextual menu**. The Music app went through a major redesign for Apple Music and Beats 1 in June, and iOS 9 brings a revamped contextual menu that packs more options in a cleaner presentation. The menu now displays a larger album artwork at the top that clearly indicates you can tap it to go to the selected item. Underneath it, new icons allow you to love a song, start a station, and share. A good improvement as Apple continues to fix and clean up the issues that affected the new Music app since launch.

Last, because of limitations in my country, unavailable hardware, or features that can only be tested after the public launch of iOS 9, here's a recap of what I couldn't test for this review:

  * Smaller software updates for new iOS releases
  * App Thinning technologies for App Store apps
  * CarPlay improvements
  * Car Reminders
  * Public transit in Maps
  * HomeKit changes
  * New HealthKit categories
  * Shared Links extensions
  * Wallet (nee Passbook) and Apple Pay
  


## Five Years On

In some ways, iOS 9 feels like the third and final installment of the iOS 7 saga.

With San Francisco, a revised keyboard, and an interface that's been polished across the OS, Apple's new design language has moved past its awkward (and problematic) teenage years to accept its own style and voice. Interfaces aren't diamonds: [they're not forever](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8pU6WQXkiOU), and iOS will change again. For now, iOS 9 is, visually speaking, a culmination of the work started two years ago, ready for what comes next.

Changes to default apps and new system features also are iterative improvements that complete Apple's post-iOS 7 vision and get rid of problems accumulated so far. Podcasts, Mail, iCloud Drive, and new features in Safari don't revolutionize those apps, but they make them substantially better for everyone. Deep links and Universal Links show that Apple has long been thinking about doing more than URL schemes to simplify opening and linking to apps. Safari View Controller extends Safari to web views in any app. User activities and app indexing for Search prove that Apple often plays the long game, showing their hand only when every technology is in place for an arguably basic utility (Spotlight) to become something new.

iOS 9 isn't Apple's new Snow Leopard. Just because some additions and changes may not be as massively popular or be instantly recognizable as a new design and custom keyboards were, it doesn't mean they don't exist. The company has put more resources into optimizing iOS, and early results are encouraging. Low Power Mode makes a difference when battery is running low, and developers will be able to support it in their apps; the entire OS feels snappier and more stable in daily usage.

This isn't the year of No New Features: under-the-hood optimizations and app enhancements walk together in iOS 9, with Notes being a prime example of it. Apple isn't taking the foot off the pedal: they're just being more careful behind the wheel.

Along the way, there are some missteps and disappointments that will have to be taken care of in the future. Mail is lagging behind the innovation we're seeing in email apps from large companies and indie studios. iCloud Drive is far from the functionality offered by Apple's OS X Finder and other companies' iOS apps. The intelligence of Apple News and proactive suggestions leaves a lot to be desired, casting doubts on whether it can dramatically improve. And as others are reimagining mobile messaging with integrations and [services](http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/) that were unimaginable a few years ago, major changes are suspiciously absent from Apple's Messages app this year.

As a result, iOS 9 for iPhone is a more efficient version of iOS that many will appreciate with time as they discover what's new. Its improvements aren't as easily marketable as iOS 7 and iOS 8, but they're not any less important. What Apple _hasn't_ done this year doesn't make iOS 9 worse: it just adds to a list of low-hanging fruit for next year.

If you're an iPhone user and you're skeptical on whether to upgrade or not, my recommendation couldn't be easier this time around: iOS 9 is better than iOS 8 in every way and you should upgrade.

And then there's the iPad.

This year, the iPad is getting the first version of iOS truly made for it. After too many unimaginative releases, Apple has understood the capabilities of the iPad's display and its nature of modern portable computer. Free of dogmas and preconceptions of what an iPad ought to be, iOS 9 fundamentally reinvents what an iPad can become going forward.

Picture in Picture rethinks watching video on the device. Slide Over cuts down the time required to jump between apps. New shortcuts make working with Bluetooth keyboards on the iPad a joy. And by using two apps at once, Split View reimagines the role of the iPad in the iOS ecosystem, positioning it between an iPhone and a Mac for people like me who need exactly _that_.

I've been working on the iPad for the past three years, and the changes in this year's iOS release have done more to make me work faster than iOS 6, 7, and 8 combined. Apple has created a new beginning for the iPad's software, and while it's not perfect and the experience will have to be refined in places, the impact of iOS 9 for iPad users - _especially_ iPad Air 2 users - will be felt in the following years.

It's not easy to blend tradition with a fresh start, but that's what iOS 9 does to the iPad. The iPad is still the device where you can immerse yourself in one app at a time. But now you can also do more, using the large screen to switch between multiple apps and tasks with multitouch. And in doing so, you'll discover that iOS 9 multitasking for iPad doesn't carry over the complexities and rules that applied to traditional desktop OSes.

Apple has leveraged years of design and interaction constraints to give more freedom to iPad users, creating an experience that can be more complex but still intuitive. The iPad is not a Mac, but the same argument works in reverse, too: a Mac is not an iPad - it can't have its portability, it doesn't have its app ecosystem, and it's not a screen you can hold in your hands. With iOS 9, there are even more reasons to consider an iPad as a new kind of computer: capable of true multitasking, and built with the strengths of iOS in mind.

With iOS 9, Apple is ready to admit that the iPad is a computer without the baggage of the PC. I know that I'm not going back to a Mac, and this review wants to be a tangible proof of it. Writing this wouldn't have been possible without iOS 9, and I've never felt more focused.

iOS 9 shows where the future of iPad is. The leap has been taken.

Five years later, it's [just like starting over](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Op-uIUIktWY).
