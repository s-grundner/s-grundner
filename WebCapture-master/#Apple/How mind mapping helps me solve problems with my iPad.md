## Mind mapping helps

Have you ever wanted a way to diagram a complicated thought or problem but did know the right format to use for your ideas? Have you ever wondered if there was a way to create a diagram on your iPad? Well, there is a great diagramming tool called mind mapping that works great on the iPad! There are many apps for mind mapping, but the one I have had the best luck with is called [iThoughtsHD (ITHD)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lo3Y). You may be wondering why I chose this app, [this review by Hans](http://blog.hansdezwart.info/2011/01/27/mind-mapping-apps-for-the-ipad-a-comparison/) convinced me that [ITHD](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lo3Y) was a great place to start.

This post will focus on my **thoughts and experiences with using mind mapping**, but first, a little history. Mind mapping came into my consciousness when I started researching the productivity apps out on the LinkedIn [Getting Things Done discussion tool discussion](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/What-tools-are-in-your-2328651.S.39987725?qid=1a22e51e-8188-482a-b1a3-de776a97f5ca&trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&goback=.gmp_2328651). For this research I took a sample of over a hundred responses to see what tools the members were using to manage their productivity. What I found is documented in [detail on this post](http://tabletproductive.com/what-to-use-to-manage-your-productivity-ask-the-experts/). The really interesting thing I noticed was that 19% of all respondents utilized some mind mapping software and of those respondents who had iPads over 20% utilized mind mapping. What was I missing? Why have I not used mind mapping yet? What the heck is mind mapping?

Let's start by checking out the easiest starting point for any research (maybe not the best), Wikipedia. The [post on wikipedia defines mind mapping a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)s follows;

"_A **mind map** is a [diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) used to represent [words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words), [ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea), tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea._ Mind maps are used to [generate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation), [visualize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_visualization), [structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure), and [classify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_classification) ideas, and as an aid to [studying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_skills) and [organizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) information, [solving problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving), [making decisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making), and writing."

### How is mind mapping different than a [flow chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_chart) ![mind mapping](http://tabletproductive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/324px-LampFlowchart.svg_-150x150.png)

or a [swim lane diagram ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane_diagram)? How would mind mapping help in a [Lean process improvement project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_process)? These are all of the questions I have going into my mind mapping project on the iPad!

I could simply quote from the Wikipedia post or do some additional research to answer these questions. However, what I really want to do is utilize mind mapping on my own with my iPad and then write about how mind mapping fits into my work life. I want to know how and where mind mapping helps with my work, specifically; how does mind mapping help me (and my teams) understand our own processes? How can mind mapping help us to break through some of the challenges we have at work? Can mind mapping help us to come up with more creative solutions to complex problems?

So, with the above questions in mind I start on my mind mapping research project. I have already started two mind maps, the one included above is the starting point for the process of scheduling a radiology exam. This is a very pertinent topic as I am currently acting as a coach on a Lean Project to improve our scheduling process. The second map is for the process of maintaining this blog. As a new blogger I am still learning all of the ins and outs of creating, maintaining and growing a blogâ€¦seems like a good process to mind map!

So far it seems clear that the iPad is a natural tool to utilize in mind mapping. Obviously the iPad is portable and easily brought to meetings and brainstorming sessions. Second, mind mapping is very visual and benefits from the use of a tablet as a diagramming tool; at least it does on iThoughtsHD. So far I am starting to see the benefits of using mind mapping on my tablet. More to come!

## What are your thoughts on mind mapping?

If you are a mind mapping veteran, am I am the right track in my thinking? Where do you use mind mapping in your work? How does it relate to the other diagramming tools? If you have never heard of mind mapping, what do you think?
