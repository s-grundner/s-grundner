_Update: I was able to resolve and workaround the problems I originally encountered and am happily Evernote-free. Your notes will probably be fine. [Many](https://twitter.com/Pogue/status/654853718630862848) [others](https://twitter.com/KevinCWoo/status/654863262866010112) successfully migrating their notes with this script._

You've just updated to iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 El Capitan. You read that Apple's updated its Notes app and are excited about moving your digital brain to iCloud. Perhaps you [read that Evernote is going to be the first Unicorn to perish](https://syrah.co/joshdickson40/55e1beac15970d6c01395d9d). Or you prefer to minimize the number of [companies you trust](http://www.apple.com/privacy/).

Whatever the reason, you've got a lot of Evernote notes and you want to move them to to Apple Notes and you don't want to do it by hand.

You're in luck! I've got just the AppleScript for you.

## Great! What do I do?

  1. [Download the script.](https://www.larrysalibra.com/downloads/evernote-to-apple-notes-1.1.1.zip) (Current version: 1.1.1)
  2. Open Evernote.
  3. Select the Evernote notes you want to export to Apple Notes.
  4. Open the file `Export Evernotes notes to Apple Notes.applescript`.
  5. Click the play button.
  6. Cross your fingers.

> _Your notes are now in Apple Notes. Hopefully._

Attachments of a few notes may fail to migrate. You'll get a list of all the notes that have this problem at the end of the migration so that you can move the attachments manually.

## Got it?
