Great artists steal - and then they iterate.

> I once had the opportunity to visit the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid. There, I got to see Guernica, one of Pablo Picasso's most famous masterpieces. The painting is gigantic and displayed in its own room. What struck me was not the piece itself, but what surrounded it: Smaller rooms each exhibiting pencil, charcoal, and paint studies of different parts of the masterpiece. In one room, 30 different strokes to get the bull's head; in another, 25 attempts at the soldier's arm.  
  
Picasso did not paint the masterpiece in one go. He experimented; he made mistakes; he iterated. When you approach product design, treat it like a great artist treats building a masterpiece. Try and discover: You will uncover new ideas.
