There are plenty of [opposing views](http://www.cultofmac.com/413020/family-of-murdered-solider-object-apples-fight-against-fbi/) about how Apple should handle the FBI's request that it add an iPhone backdoor to allow the government to read user messages if national security depends on it.

One idea we haven't heard before, however, is a concept put forward by former Apple CEO John Sculley.

In an in-depth interview with Cult of Mac -- the rest of which will be published tomorrow -- Sculley proposes an idea we've not personally heard before: that Apple help provide the information it is being asked for, but that it (not the government) is in charge of reading the messages.

> "We're in an era where terrorism is a threat to the future of civilization," Sculley told Cult of Mac. "I'm sensitive to the fact that we want to know as much as we can about people who are trying to destroy us. But governments are imperfect. Giving them a backdoor to look at everyone's private information is pretty high-risk. In all likelihood, it will at some point be abused and it opens Pandora's box.

> I'm not an expert on it, but one of the most interesting ideas I've heard is that, if we really need to find out information about an individual suspect, I would rather that Apple be the one that can look inside and give feedback about what they've found under a proper court order.
> 
> But I think the precedent should not be that Apple gives the government all of its information, but rather that Apple is the one in control if a particular circumstance arises."

You can check out the rest of our exclusive interview with John Sculley tomorrow, in which he discusses his book _Moonshot_, his thoughts on the Apple Watch, how he wishes he had handled Steve Jobs' departure at Apple differently, the accuracy of Aaron Sorkin's _Steve Jobs_ movie, and much more.

In the meantime, do you agree with his thesis that Apple is more worthy of being trusted with personal information than the U.S. government? Is there any way that the decision made in this particular case doesn't become a precedent-setter that opens up other users for having their personal data read? Leave your comments below.
