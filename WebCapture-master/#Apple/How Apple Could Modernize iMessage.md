# How Apple Could Modernize iMessage

I don't usually cover concepts and mockups here at MacStories, but [this idea by Michael Steeber](http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/23/changing-the-conversation-how-apple-could-modernize-imessage-to-be-more-powerful-and-easy-to-use/) is exactly what I've been wanting to see in Apple's Messages app for a long time.

> One of the best parts of these inline previews is that they aren't limited just to the Messages app. The same previews could work in other Apple apps like Mail and Notes, or even in third party apps that support document-style text input. A feature like this, while subtle in implementation, has the potential to save a significant amount of time and remove points of friction in anyone's workflow. 

Steeber has come up with several ideas for inline previews, such as web links and Twitter, but also calendar invitations, documents, notes, and weather conditions.

Here's what I wrote in [my iOS 9 wishes in May](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-wishes/):

> Messaging services like Slack and Messenger have proven the utility of automatically generating previews for content shared in conversations such as direct links to images, tweets, or web articles. Considering Apple's integration with Twitter and Safari's Reader capabilities, I'm surprised they didn't consider richer previews for content shared over iMessage before. Compared to the aforementioned messaging services, sharing links to web content on iMessage feels primitive, without the context granted by snippets of information embedded directly in a conversation. It's time for a refresh. 

As messaging continues to grow as an interface of its own, it only makes sense to make conversations faster and more contextual by using rich previews of what's being shared. Considering that [Apple is using open standards](http://www.macstories.net/stories/inside-ios-9-search-apples-plan-for-more-connected-apps/) such as schema.org and Open Graph for rich results in iOS 9's Search, they could use a similar system to build rich previews in Messages as well.
