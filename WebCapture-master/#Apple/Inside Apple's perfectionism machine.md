CUPERTINO, California -- In retrospect, it was easy to miss -- a bit of combined technology never really seen before in a laptop. Everyone missed it, even those who tore down the ultra-portable [MacBook](http://mashable.com/2015/04/09/apple-new-macbook-review/), even those who looked right at it.

The little strip of black along the two back edges of the MacBook's twin speakers could easily have been mistaken for a bit of shielding or a vibration dampener. Except, that's not what it is.

Some like to call it the "Speaktenna." The black strip along the back edge of the MacBook speakers is a never-before-tried combination of speakers and antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It's a fairly ingenious bit of space-saving technology that teardown artists ignored.

But that's not really the story. It's about what "speaktenna" represents: the Apple way of conceiving, designing and building its products.

> _The Speaktenna_

Phil Schiller, Apple's longtime senior vice president of worldwide marketing, is waiting for me when I arrive at Building 3 at the company's Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino, California on an unusually warm fall day. He's wearing his trademark gray button-down shirt and, incongruously, a pair of glasses that he quickly removes.

Schiller doesn't give a lot of interviews. A quick Google search tends to bring up quotes from keynotes and [one lengthy chat](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/06/09/ep-123) with _Daring Fireball_'s John Gruber.

Schiller is, for most people, a cipher: A highly knowledgeable Apple spokesperson who can speak as passionately about its products as his late boss, Steve Jobs. In fact, to listen to Schiller speak is to hear echoes of the visionary leader who died in 2011. It occurs to me more than once that, perhaps, many of turns of phrase we often attributed to Jobs may have actually started with Schiller.

![](http://1.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/schiller.jpg)

Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987 as the company was launching the Mac SE and Mac II (and, like as Jobs did, left the company only to return in 1997), has seen a lot of change in the last two decades. He described those changes in a somewhat Jobsian way: "A couple of things that I observe are different and, I think, incredibly great compared to the past."

"From the beginning, the Mac has been about Apple taking responsibility for the whole thing: hardware, software, how applications can work and, increasingly, Internet services. But that means something different today than it did 20 years ago," Schiller said.

"Today, those teams are not only integrated and designing something together, they're actually thinking of features that could only exist because of that integration and solving problems that could only be solved because of that unique advantage."

It's a recurrent theme in my conversations with Schiller and John Ternus, vice president of Mac and iPad engineering. As they see it, much of the innovation -- certainly something like the speaktenna -- inside the 2-pound, 0.5-inch-thick laptop would not have been possible without disparate teams working together.

In the case of the speaktenna, Apple engineers did everything in their power to fit the maximum amount of technology possible into the tiny anodized aluminum chassis. This included creating new battery chemistry and forms to support a terraced battery design that marries perfectly with matching cutouts in the chassis. There's even a deeper level of terracing cutouts in the body that aren't for more battery power, but to cut down on the overall system weight.

"We realized we could not create a great antennae and a great speaker because we'd be compromising," Ternus said. "Both of those elements need space. Antenna elements are small, but they need cavity; they need space to resonate."

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/macbook-casing-for-battery.jpg)

> _MacBook casing_

The answer was to make the speaker and antenna teams collaborate to create something new.

"We absolutely married them together to make this happen," said Ternus, who laid out before me a disemboweled MacBook. I saw what looked like a regular pair of gold-plated speaker housings that sit at the back of the MacBook, near the hinge. Along both rear speaker edges was a millimeter or so of black material, which turned out to be the antennas.

"We ended up with a group of antenna engineers who know more about speakers than any other antenna engineers and a group of speaker engineers who knew more about antenna design than just about anyone else in the world," Ternus said with a laugh.

That level of collaboration is part of the company's DNA today. But this wasn't always the case.

"Before Jony [Ive] and Steve came back, there was a relationship between the industrial design team and the engineering teams, but not an integrated one," Schiller recalled. "The industrial design team might create some models and designs and those may not reflect the product that was ultimately made or they may not result in any product at all."

It was, put simply, much less of a clear path from product conception to production. There was, instead, a sort of back and forth between groups, where one would come up with an idea, lob it over the wall to the other group -- design or engineering -- which would then throw back over its concepts.

This is in stark contrast to how things work today.

"One of the amazing things for me is how stable things stay from first models that we make to the products that we ship," Ternus said.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iphone-6s-bottom.jpg)

Schiller recalled that turning point in development and design, which led to products like the reinvented iMacs of the turn of the century and categories new to Apple -- like the iPod, iPhone and iPad.

"Ever since Steve came back [in 1997] and worked with Jony on redefining the entire process, the industrial design teams, the engineering teams are joined at the hip in the work they do," Schiller said. "They think up solutions to problems together as the disciplines are merged into a seamless process."

Beyond collaboration, Apple relies heavily on institutional memory to build upon past achievements.

"It is very deeply ingrained in how we work, and it's also something that is amazing to watch because it's a process that is building on itself each year," Schiller said. "These learnings all help to create the next product we're making, regardless of what part of the company it comes from."

It's also evident in the MacBook parts laid out before me. The tiny logic board (aka the motherboard) fits in one of my hands. It's literally packed on both sides with chips of varying sizes and includes everything from memory to storage and even the display drivers. It's also deeply informed by everything Apple learned from building circuit boards for handheld technologies like the iPhone. As I examine it, Ternus tells me the board is 67 percent smaller than the one found in the 11-inch MacBook Air.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/macbook-cutaway.jpg)

Apple may have mastered coming up with new solutions for tough technology problems, but it doesn't always have the answers or resources in house.

"There are times when we have to add resources to Apple, grow talent to do something that we weren't able to do before," Schiller said.

And then there are times when Apple has to make others change what they do to meet _its_ expectations.

Apple has a habit of leaning on suppliers in ways few other companies would do. Schiller said it's not uncommon for Apple to refine third-party part specification and to help suppliers deliver exactly what the company needs to achieve its original product vision.

Sometimes "we're asking for technologies and features they've never created before or brought to market, things that [our partners] wished they could do, but were never able to do," he said.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/inside-macbook.jpg)

> _Inside the MacBook_

"Almost every new product has a new material, process or technology that we've never done before," said Ternus, "and, in many cases, no one has ever done before."

Of course, Apple works with many suppliers because, ultimately, they do not build the individuals parts. Apple specs out what it needs and then finds someone who can build it for them. In the case of Corning, which supplied Gorilla Glass for the original iPhone, Corning had the glass technology, but, in a world filled with mostly plastic phones, cellphone manufacturers weren't willing to buy and use it.

"We had a higher expectation of what the experience should be and we had a partner who was amazing at delivering on that," said Schiller, offering rare, third-party-vendor-specific praise.

Of course, Apple's relationship with these partners is more complicated than that. Direct questions about who supplies Apple's signature glass screens and, sometimes, backs, has often been met with silence or obfuscation. So it came as a surprise when, at the unveiling of the [iPhone 6S](http://mashable.com/2015/09/22/iphone-6s-review-apple/) and [6S Plus](http://mashable.com/2015/09/22/apple-iphone-6s-plus-review/), Apple casually shared that they both featured Corning Glass (not necessarily Corning _Gorilla_ glass).

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/motherboard-1.jpg)

Why can't Apple consistently share where it gets its parts?

In part, it's because Apple doesn't always source parts from a single supplier, Schiller said. He added that those partnerships can change, meaning the parts change.

Take a look the recent news about the two simultaneous A9 chip suppliers (Samsung and TSMC) and possible battery performance differences -- a claim [Apple quickly disputed](http://mashable.com/2015/10/09/battery-life-iphone/#1324f41kUiq5). In general, Apple simply doesn't want to constantly explain the potential minuscule differences between part suppliers or when they choose a completely different supplier.

There is a larger reason, though.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/motherboard-2.jpg)

> _Motherboard, part 2_

"The most common scenario is simply that what we got from a supplier basically has been created so uniquely for Apple that implying it's an off-the-shelf part like others may get would be really misleading," Schiller said. "So it's best not to even talk about the source because that implies things that aren't true."

Ternus said it was, for the MacBook, a pattern repeated again and again. The full-sized keyboard that essentially defined the overall size of the MacBook could not simply be sourced from a company adept at building laptop keyboard modules. Apple found a keyboard supplier, and then redesigned the keyboard, including the mechanisms under each key, from the ground up.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/macbook-keyboard.jpg)

Inside the Apple bubble, a giant campus with more than 10,000 employees, it's easy to lose introspection. Yet, when I ask Schiller if Apple does _everything_ well, his answer surprises me.

"No, of course not, of course not," he said. "And we don't want to sound like we're perfect. We never are, we always have to get better and always have to listen to where we're not doing well."

Apple, Schiller said, is also always up for re-examining preconceived notions, whether that means selling a [large-screen iPad](http://mashable.com/2015/09/10/ipad-pro-8-things/) with an optional stylus (the [Apple Pencil](http://mashable.com/2015/09/10/apple-pencil-mistake/#fXsLJdVPLsqB)) or creating something entirely new.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ipad-pro.jpg)

> _The canvas gets bigger_

"When we look at creating each new product, one of the great things about the process is the product teams are free to re-imagine a product any way that would make it better. They're not tied to a schedule, to force it into a specific time window, not tied to past definitions of the product," said Schiller.

Radically different products put pressure on Apple and its suppliers who are sometime asked to change their factories to support Apples plans. I wondered if anyone within Apple ever vetoed one of these crazy ideas.

Ternus, though, told me "no" isn't a very popular term at Apple. "There's 'No's' in some way," he explained, adding, "There's 'No's' about what we do, but in terms of how we do it, going and making the best product there really aren't a lot of 'No's.' That's one of the great joys of working here. [For] something really compelling. We can afford to make it happen."

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/macbook-usb-c.jpg)

> _One port to rule them all_

Building the new certainly gets you noticed. We were all surprised when Apple unveiled the new MacBook, a laptop shorn of the "Air" moniker as well as all its ports save one: [USB-C](http://mashable.com/2015/03/09/apple-macbook-usb-c-explained/).

That kind of risk-taking can appear both bold and dangerous. It's a delicate balance not lost on Schiller, who said Apple puts a lot of thought into meeting expectations while advancing the state of the art.

"We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes," he said.

Schiller contends that people expect a little bit of daring when it comes to the MacBook. "It's a little counterintuitive to people, that doing what people don't expect, ends up being what people do expect. But that is true of Mac."

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/store-watches.jpg)

Radical innovation, though, isn't possible without the level of intense collaboration Apple currently enjoys, according to Schiller and Ternus.

As I walked through the sprawling Cupertino campus with Schiller, noting how Apple employees hurried past, lost in their own product conundrum thoughts, perhaps not even noticing Schiller, I marveled at the sheer number of people. During the lunch hour, employees jockey for table space in the lunchroom. That room faces a large quad into which all of Infinite Loop's building faces.

As a result, Apple employees are often spotted walking between buildings, passing by each other, and perhaps, stopping to chat. To some extent, the design may be a reflection of Jobs' desire for serendipitous interaction (he reportedly helped design Pixar's headquarters for just that effect).

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/battery.jpg)

However, if you were to go to the third floor of Building 3 or 4 and stare east you would see, rising in the distance, Apple's new "Spaceship" campus, which may eventually house almost all the employees from One Infinite Loop.

The 2.8-million-square-foot building is a circle with a giant quad in the center. It's hard to imagine how employees will get around it, let alone collaborate as they've been doing for decades at One Infinite Loop.

What, I wondered, would happen if one team was seated on one side of the circle and another all the way on the other side? Would collaboration suffer?

"Quite the opposite," Schiller said. "The design of the new campus has been all about fostering collaboration."

Apple, Schiller said, is well aware of the collaborative platform that the current building offers. The open quad means people can always grab a chair for impromptu meetings, though Schiller says its standalone buildings aren't actually as conducive to continual collaboration.

"Whereas, with the new campus, everything about it is designed for that. From the fact that, on the ring, the internal and external surface of the ring are the hallways, and they completely traverse the space," he said. "So you can walk through the entire space, both on the inside and outside perimeter and go from section to section."

"It has, obviously, the biggest, open quad-like space you can imagine and it's being designed to encourage us all to mingle and travel through it with pathways and even running trails through the campus. It has very large, open stairways and spaces vertically through the place both for its airflow and light, but also it creates a floor between the sections. We're creating an environment with large, open spaces between everyone's seating areas to foster much more work together in communal space," Schiller said.

By this time, Schiller had gotten pretty excited. He obviously spends a lot of time thinking about Apple's new headquarters.

However, he caught himself and reminded me that he's not the architecture expert.

"But, absolutely, this is going to be the most incredible collaborative space that's been created."

Surely a phrase that Jobs would be proud of.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/macbook-opening.jpg)

In-house collaboration and outside partnership on new designs and technologies only takes Apple partway to an obvious goal.

The company does not exist in a vacuum. It's part of a vast, competitive landscape where Apple is far from the leader in desktop and laptop PCs. But it's bucking the current downward trend where PC market leaders are slipping quarter over quarter.

Apple just reported a record 5.7 million Macs sold in the last quarter; over the past 12 months, it's sold more than 20 million Macs -- more than any other year. Late last year, IDC reported Apple's U.S. PC market share had grown to more than 13 percent.

Schiller, however, told me that estimate was conservative.

"There are endless numbers of stats out there, you can quote any of them to tell any story, but the number that closest reflects what we all experience and see as we travel around is actually a U.S. market share approaching 25 percent," he said. "That closer reflects what we see when we go to the airport, when we go to the coffee shop, when we go to schools. You increasingly are seeing more Macs than PCs."

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/campus-walk.jpg)

> _Collaborative energy_

Schiller was referring to the perception-versus-reality problem that dogs Apple.

Even as Mac sales numbers grow, Apple is consistently reported well behind Lenovo and HP, which, as of late 2014, had between 18 and 20 percent worldwide market share, respectively, compared to Apple's 6 percent[ global numbers](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/07/apple-mac-us-pc-record/).

Standing in a startup office, at a college lecture or on an airplane, it may look as if every other person (or more) is using a Mac. So why don't the numbers match the optics?

"I think what offsets that is maybe IT purchases or system integration projects or other things," Schiller said. "Why you don't see over 50 percent, because it sure feels like it in the real world. I feel like more people like Macs than other things and they're not equal."

Schiller's perception, though, is accurate. NPD analyst Stephen Baker confirmed those market-share numbers, which represent retail and consumer sales (including those in Apple Stores). It does not include sales to enterprise customers, through resellers and large OEMs. In the NPD data, which tracks sales and not shipments, the company is still behind HP, but Apple has been "slowly gaining share on Windows and the Windows brands," according to Baker.

For Schiller and Apple, that trajectory matters.

"The trajectory has been a market where the majority of PC vendors are not doing well; they're shrinking and we're growing," Schiller said. "That's reflected in an increasing market share and the number I quoted is the highest we've had since the start of the Mac. Our highest market share."

Apple, however, is growing at a time of sea change in the PC industry, where devotion to a piece of hardware may be less important than connection to files, content and services. As the cloud looms larger, will the hardware we use still matter? Schiller rejects this notion.

"No. 1, the importance and value of great hardware has not diminished in any way," he said. "Across the board, our goal is to make the best in the categories we choose to compete in. It's what we're doing and it's reflected in customers choosing our products over anyone else's. So I do think people are showing with their choice that they do value quality and beauty of the hardware and that is not diminishing."

"I have never heard anyone say, 'Because I like to keep my stuff in the cloud, I will take a cheap piece of hardware and I want it to be ugly.' All things being equal, of course, nobody wants that," Schiller said.

He also rejects the idea that there's a growing market for hybrids, or, to be more specific, laptops with touch screens that also happen to be tablets.

"There certainly are more offerings today, more people trying to create a market. But based on all the data that I've been able to see, it is still incredibly small and niche and may not be growing to anything significant. Time will tell," he told me.

Schiller didn't mention Microsoft by name, but the implication was clear. He doesn't believe products like the swiftly selling [Surface Pro](http://mashable.com/2015/10/21/microsoft-surface-pro-4-review/) or new [Surface Book](http://mashable.com/2015/10/21/microsoft-surface-book-review/) quite represent a trend.

In particular, Schiller doesn't just believe that people are choosing products like the Mac because they appreciate the innovation and craftsmanship. He contends that they love them.

"It's important to us and something we're lucky to have and it's never lost on us that we have customers who really deeply love these products."

Customers' adoration for their Macs is not a new phenomenon, according to Schiller.

"This is something that goes back to the first generations of the Macs that people felt an attachment and a bond, and cared about their Macs in a way that you would normally not expect from inanimate objects," he said.

"Truth be told, knowing that that can be the case, we certainly try to support and enhance that, not only when delivering amazing products, but identifying with them ourselves."

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/apple-watch.jpg)

If you know -- or at least believe -- that your customers have an affinity for your products that goes beyond the norm, you may do unusual things.

As we looked over the pieces of MacBook, examining the tiny logic board and usual speaktenna, Ternus encouraged me to lift the lid of the completed MacBook he'd placed before me.

I placed the edge of one finger on the base to hold it in place and started to lift the lid. Ternus told me to stop holding the bottom and just lift the top. I did as I was told and noted how the bottom did not move as opened the MacBook. Ternus said that it's no accident.

It's also an indication of the care Apple put into tolerances on the ultraportable.

"Every single unit gets measured on line for force required to open it, and we actually adjust every single unit," Ternus said.

In fact, Apple is apparently taking the time to custom-fit all sorts of pieces in the MacBook through a process it calls "binning." Since there can be minuscule variances that might make, for instance, the Force Touch trackpad not a perfect fit for the body or the super-thin Retina display not exactly a match for the top of the case, Apple finds matching parts from the production line. Even the thickness of the stainless steel Apple Logo, which replaced the backlit logo on previous MacBook models, can vary by a micron or so, meaning Apple needs to find a top with the right cutout depth.

Pretty much all of Apple's manufacturing partners use robots and laser-vision systems.

![](http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/store.jpg)

The result is that every MacBook is, in a way, special and imperceptibly different. I joked that every MacBook is like a Cabbage Patch Kid. "Every one is unique," I said. Ternus finished the thought: "all in an effort to make them the same."

It's an almost unprecedented attention to detail. And with each successive generation of Mac, Apple is getting better at it.

"You see a Mac today and its level of technology integration, the specifications for how tight the tolerances have to be and on and on are higher this year than they were a year ago, and a year before that, and a year before that," Schiller said. "As you learn to do something better, you can then build on that. Next year you now assume you can to that and try to figure out where else you can push the boundaries."

Talking to Schiller and Ternus, it occurs to me that the concept of Mac fanboys and fangirls is inside-out. The so-called cult of Apple doesn't begin and end outside its headquarters and Chinese factories. It is a part of Apple itself, a sort of cult of perfectionism that has been driving product development for 20 years.

For those struggling to understand what Apple is up to, it might be best to imagine the Apple logo as a giant, rose gold-colored apple sculpture that's being polished beyond perfection, to some sort of ideal, a level of quality that is so undeniable that no competitor dares forget it.

Before I left, Schiller walked me over to the brand-new on-campus Apple Store. Compared to other Apple Stores around the world, it's relatively small. But like most others, it was bustling. Here I saw the 27-inc Mac with its redesigned keyboard and minimalist Magic Trackpad.

Schiller smiled as he touched the devices. He loves these products and fully expects you will, too.
