The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 46 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover a patent relating to validating calibrated magnetometer data for iDevices and vehicle applications and an Apple Watch stand design patent. We wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.

Granted Patent: Validating Calibrated Magnetometer Data

Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to validating data retrieved from a calibration database. In some implementations, calibrated magnetometer data for a magnetometer of a mobile device is retrieved from a calibration database and validated by data from another positioning system, such as course or heading data provided by a satellite-based positioning system. In some implementations, one or more context keys are used to retrieve magnetometer calibration data from a calibration database that is valid for a particular context of the mobile device, **such as when the mobile device is mounted in a vehicle. **In some implementations, currently retrieved calibration data is compared with previously retrieved calibration data to determine if the currently retrieved calibration data is valid.
