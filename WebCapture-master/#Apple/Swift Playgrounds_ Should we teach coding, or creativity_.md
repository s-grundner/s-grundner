# Swift Playgrounds: Should we teach coding, or creativity?

Apple had their big keynote this week and they dropped a seemingly simple but very powerful product at the very end of the presentation: [Swift Playgrounds](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/). It's an iPad app that's meant to make it easier for children and teens to get into coding and learn the fundamentals of Swift using real time feedback and gorgeous visuals.

As a lot of pundits already claimed, this could be revolutionary for teaching coding to kids, and that's great. The Playgrounds app looks and feels amazing, with a lot of thought and attention given to every lesson and template. It will go a long way towards creating that spark in young brains. That said, I can't help but wonder if putting the focus on _coding_ instead of _creativity_ is the right way to go. To properly explain what I mean, we need to travel back in time a few decades.

### Once Upon A Time: HyperCard

I was introduced to my first Mac in 1991, when I was 8 years old. It was a [Macintosh Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic), one of the first fairly affordable Macs that were meant for simple word processing and simple educational software. My mom needed it to finish writing her doctoral thesis, but I immediately had other plans for it, such as playing Crystal Quest!

For the first couple of years I was completely hooked on games such as Prince of Persia, Dark Castle and Adventure. Lack of Internet meant that getting new games was almost impossible, and soon enough I began to explore ways of building my own games. I remember sketching puzzle adventures on paper and guiding my friends through these analogue adventure games.

Then I discovered HyperCard.

> _A more modern version of HyperCard_

Created by the legendary Bill Atkinson in 1987, HyperCard was a proto-development tool that combined basic drawing and user interface creation capabilities with interactivity and data storage. It wasn't obvious at first, but it was immensely powerful. You could create games, specialized software, presentations or just silly demos. To a 10 year old obsessed with creating adventure games, it was a gold mine.

HyperTalk, an object oriented scripting language that you could use to add logic to your "cards" was very accessible and readable, mainly because it used a simplified version of English and you didn't need to learn a lot of lingo or syntax logic to modify existing HyperCard stacks. Much like the web that would come later, you could actually inspect how stacks were developed, making it really easy to learn by example.

### Creativity versus Consumption

So, why are we still talking about a piece of software that was created almost 30 years ago? To me, the power of HyperCard came from a few things:

  * **Blank Canvas:** HyperCard didn't try to teach you coding. It really didn't _try_ to do anything. It just gave you a blank canvas that you could do anything you wanted on. This had two advantages: You had to work hard to learn, and you also had to use your imagination and creativity to find solutions and build the things you wanted.
  * **Learn By Example:** Much like the early days of web, HyperCard allowed you to inspect existing stacks, learning from people who figured things out before you did. In my experience, this is the best way to learn because it forces you to deconstruct existing software and build new things by tinkering.
  * **Share Easily:** HyperCard stacks could be shared with anyone with ease. If you had a Mac, you could run a HyperCard stack. No need to deal with provisioning, signing or setting up.

In some ways, Swift Playgrounds tries to follow the legacy of HyperCard (it does have some limited form of sharing and inspection). But in many ways, it fails to do so because it's so stuck in the idea that we need to teach our children _how to code_. Coding is a by-product of creativity, it's just a tool. Our objective shouldn't be to teach kids Swift, it should be to teach kids to learn, to open their minds and create. Swift Playgrounds could be a step in that direction, but it feels too closed and myopic.

Another big problem that I see with Playgrounds is that it doesn't give the kids a blank canvas. It's too focused on holding hands and not letting go. When you see a beautifully rendered floating island with a cute creature jumping around, that becomes your anchor. You immediately limit yourself to what's being presented to you and you consume instead of coming up with new ways of thinking, of imagining new worlds.
