A while back we posted an [instructional video showing how to create a ringtone right on your iPhone](http://appchasers.com/2014/03/21/video-how-to-create-iphone-ringtones-using-only-garageband-on-your-iphone/). The great thing is that you can do it all on your iPhone without the assistance of a computer or jailbreaking your device. The downside is that you could only use audio already in your Music app. So, the lingering question was "how can I create a ringtone using audio sounds from the web?" The answer involves the amazing app called Workflow. If you read AppChasers frequently, you already know Workflow can accomplish almost anything you want to do on your iPhone and iPad. If you'd like to see what we mean, check out [our full review of the app here](http://appchasers.com/2015/01/19/video-review-how-to-use-workflow-to-automate-your-iphone-and-ipad/). Not surprisingly then, Workflow can also help you create custom ringtones right on your iPhone without needing a computer or iTunes. It does so in combination with another app, GarageBand by Apple.

What you'll need:

You will first need to download the Workflow and GarageBand apps, see the following links.

You'll also need this premade workflow (handcrafted by AppChasers). Just click on **[this link](https://workflow.is/workflows/2f2540fc7b114c1487c6441b4cd7d770)** or the image below and it will be imported into your Workflow app.

Now, to begin creating your ringtone, please follow the steps below:

1) On your iPhone (or iPad) go to [free-ringtones.cc](http://free-ringtones.cc) to quickly find pre-made ringtones (you can also search any site for an mp3 file to convert).

2) Once you've found the file you want, tap play to preview and make sure this is the sound you want.

3) If this is the correct sound, tap and hold on the "Download ringtone" button and then tap "Copy".

4) Now open the Workflow app and run the previously imported "Make Ringtone" workflow.

5) Once the workflow has completed, open the GarageBand app and start a new song with the Audio Recorder instrument.

6) Switch to Track View by pressing the icon that looks like 5 stacked lines in the upper left.

7) Now quickly tap in the first square to the right of the microphone image and paste your file. Optionally, you can adjust the position to where you want the ringtone to start and end. Do this my grabbing the start and end handles.

8) Tap the down arrow in the upper left. Tap My Songs to exit Track view.

9) Tap Select in the upper right. Highlight your song by taping on it. Then tap the Share icon (looks like a square with and arrow).

10) Select Ringtone from the Share sheet. Name your ringtone and the tap Export in the upper right.

11) Lastly, you can use the sound as a ringtone, text tone, or assign it only to a specific contact. And your done. The new ringtone can also be found in your Settings app under Sounds.

12) If you'd ever like to delete any of your custom ringtone, follow steps 9 and 10 and then select "Your Ringtones". Here you'll tap "Edit" in the upper right and then you can delete the tones.

Check out the following gallery for a visual walk-through of all the steps.

Using Workflow and GarageBand, the sky is the limit to the amount of ringtones you can create and install right on your iPhone.
