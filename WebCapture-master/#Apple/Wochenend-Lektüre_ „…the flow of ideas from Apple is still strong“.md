Langjahrige Apple-Beobachter wie etwa der ehemalige WSJ-Journalist Walt Mossberg, The Verge-Grunder Joshua Topolsky und der fruhe Redaktionschef der inzwischen eingestellten Printausgabe der amerikanischen Macworld, Jason Snell, haben Apples September-Event zum Anlass genommen, ihr Gedanken zu einem „Apple unter Tim Cook" zu Papier zu bringen.

Lesenswerte, lange Texte, die wir euch im Anschluss verlinkt haben und zur entspannten Wochenend-Lekture empfehlen mochten. Vielleicht habt ihr eurer Pocket-Applikation ja noch Patz fur eine Handvoll kritischer, uberraschter, lobender und nachdenklicher Stimmen.

## Apple didn't "blow it" with the stylus, it did what was right

> Steve Jobs' famous crusade against styluses was not because he hated them, but because they were used as the primary way to interact with devices. All of Apple's competitors were designing their interfaces around the stylus, with tiny, precision elements that needed a pointing device to actually use them. That's how they blew it.

## What I learned this week about Tim Cook's Apple

> I have no idea how well these latest products will sell. And I care nothing at all for what Wall Street thinks of them. But I think they show that the flow of ideas from Apple is still strong. Even in years when Apple isn't taking the really big swings, like an entirely new product category or service, its control over the levers of both hardware and software allow it to iterate in more meaningful and important ways than anyone else.

## Thoughts and Observations Regarding 'Hey Siri' Apple Event

> Everything visible inside the Bill Graham Center was installed by Apple. Most of the structure was built just for the event. They even bought all the seating -- you should probably contact Apple if you're looking to buy theater seating. Effectively, Apple designed and built their own custom theater just for this event. It looked great. Especially the screen -- that was the biggest and best screen I can recall at an Apple event. The acoustics and sound quality were excellent as well.

## Notebook: Apple's newest product announcements

> The Siri implementation on stage was mind-blowing, but in the presentation rooms afterward it was a little more like the Siri we know and don't entirely love. It's a service that's always getting better, and when you learn the right way to phrase a command, it can work like magic. Integrating Siri into the Apple TV remote is a great idea--you hold down the Siri button and say your command--and the implementation, which floats above the standard Apple TV menu, seems very smart. I guess you could say I'm bullish on the Apple TV--it looks like it may have been worth the wait.

## iPad Pro with Apple Pencil

> Unlike the Surface Pro 3, which bundles a digital Pen, Apple charges $99 for its optional digital Pencil (Microsoft's Pen costs $50 on its own; it isn't included in the lower-end Surface 3). That price difference reflects the fact that Apple's Pencil is more sophisticated in a number of ways. […] Apple Pencil has no buttons. In addition to detecting pressure, it can also detect angle and orientation, allowing it to perform as more than just a simple stylus; it can more closely emulate the behaviors of a pencil, charcoal or brush. That's likely why Apple selected the name Pencil rather than pen or stylus, both of which evoke an earlier generation of input sticks.
