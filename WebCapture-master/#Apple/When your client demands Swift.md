# When your client demands Swift

Every day, more and more developers are being hired based on their Swift skills. Apple is committed to Swift and Swift is the future. Not a day goes by without some developer wandering by for Swift peer support with "I have to use Swift" because it's in the contract.

I have shipped only one Swift app for live app store sale and I absolutely _love_ Swift. Everything else remains in Objective-C. And, yes, it's painful to move back and forth between languages. As my brain trains for Swift, my Objective-C reflexes are taking a big hit.

Swift, despite migration support and ever increasing stability of language fundamentals, is not stable or will be for a while to come. So how do you break the news to your client, your boss, or that new guy on your team who saw a few WWDC videos that Swift is better suited for a long-term investment than short-term development tasks?

From a smart manager's point of view, existing code bases, a known stable development path, and a pool of trained developers is more valuable than a scary new language still in development. The lower the risk of failure the better: deadlines are everything when it comes to bonuses, promotions, and job stability. When you have a stable Objective-C code base, why risk your credibility, your job, and your career for an unstable language and API? Experienced managers are the easy sell.

But more and more, people are coming to me and saying, "It's next to impossible to explain this and sell Objective-C inside any large group or corporation. They look at you as if you're crazy. Apple says Swift is now. They don't get the push back." Apple's message of "Swift now. Swift for production" is becoming a big issue for developers.

Unless you can express a strong message of investment, stability, risk, and reward you're going to be in trouble. I'm not saying "Don't develop in Swift." For many developers, the language benefits outweigh the refactoring costs that will be incurred over the next few years. It's the people who don't see the full picture and timeline that are and will be struggling, the ones jumping in without properly seeing warning signs.

It takes a good six months or so to retrain your brain into Swift development patterns. It will take several more years for the language to stabilize. When you think "Swift", you shouldn't be thinking quick-hit-then-walk-away projects. A Swift project means a long term commitment, unless you never plan to re-use any source code, fix any bugs, or provide any upgrades to your apps.

This isn't the first time the industry has met this issue: think about how C# developed over its first decade. I'm told that many programmers found little projects, worked through them, and gradually built libraries and codebases to minimize maintenance costs over time. Now, as then, training and acquiring developers in anticipation of language stability is and was a challenge.

It comes down to this. If someone is pushing hard for Swift for full apps or critical production code, make sure they know the commitment they're buying into with associated migration and core refactoring costs, such. Otherwise, Objective-C is still, and will continue, delivering product.
