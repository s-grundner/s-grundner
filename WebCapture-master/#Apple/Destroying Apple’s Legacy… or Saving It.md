# Destroying Apple’s Legacy… or Saving It

_Captured: 2015-09-11 at 17:30 from [cheerfulsw.com](http://cheerfulsw.com/2015/destroying-apples-legacy/)_

Jony Ive has produced some of the best industrial design in the history of consumer products.

He's done it by cutting out all the extraneous parts. By eliminating edges, by smoothing and streamlining.

**But what works beautifully for hardware does not work for software.**

The "purity" of Jony's designs inspired a lot of reflection in the software design community. A few critics got their panties in a twist over the faux leather, stitching, and colored backgrounds. Because it was "skeuomorphic." Because software isn't "real."

This kicked off a witch hunt against anything that is remotely "real" in its style -- stitching, yes, but also buttons, outlines, and shading.

There was never any evidence that a few decorative pixels hurt the user.

But Apple killed it all, anyway.

> This view in the Clock app pretty much sums up every problem with Apple's new direction in interface design:
> 
>   * The awkward, time-wasting, inaccurate 3 dimensional "dial."
>   * The capricious use of red text - and only red text - for "clickable."
>   * The inconsistent bolding.
>   * Labels (which never change) styled with more visual impact than the actual data (which does).
>   * The confusion of button vs data element.
>   * All _four_ different types of data elements styled the same, with the same visual weight. 
>   * The lack of information hierarchy and priority.

## It's true, there _are_ design choices that _can_ harm the user

But by and large, graphic design isn't the issue.

The real problems are _interaction_ and _information_ design problems:

  * misusing metaphors (e.g. turning buttons into links)
  * eliminating the only affordances that software can have -- visual affordances
  * using _fake_ physical metaphors for _interactions_, such as using "wheels" for data entry 
  * eliminating information hierarchy - homogenizing spacing and typography, for "visual tidiness"
  * giving _all_ types of interface widgets the _same_ visual appearance
  * reusing the same interaction design for click UIs (on 13″-27″ screens) and touch UIs (on 5″ screens)
  * tiny tap or click targets with invisible boundaries
  * software and icons that all look the same

Apple used to publish the HIG -- the human interface guidelines -- to teach designers, inside Apple and out, to avoid these kinds of mistakes, and what to do instead.

But now Apple commits these errors left and right.

This is the kind of thing that happens when the industry forgets that _design is not an end in and of itself, but rather a tool to be used_.

## Design is how it _works_.

And "it" doesn't "work" in isolation. Design is how it works for a _human being_.

Human beings have a pretty consistent set of needs. These needs have been explored over more than 40 years of experimental research into human-computer interaction.

Below are some of the most basic HCI rules established over the decades.

While a list of "Don'ts" will never yield an innovative and beautiful product, _they are necessary to stay on track_.

**A user should never have to…**

  * A user should never have to ask themselves: "Is that clickable?"
  * A user should never have to pause and be concerned: "Wait, am I in the right app?"
  * A user should never wonder: "Did that tap… work?"
  * A user should never have to use a widget where proper use impedes accuracy (e.g. a date/time scroll wheel, where scrolling with your finger _covers_ the time being selected).
  * A user should never have to click on every single element to figure out which is a radio button, which is an on/off, which is a multi-select, which is editable text.
  * A user should never have to wonder about the purpose of the menu bar.
  * A user should never, ever, EVER be mistaken about whether the Shift key is active.
  * A user shouldn't have to work harder to read text because it is made out of "translucent material."

These rules are small, and basic. Break _one_ of these rules and it's not a big deal. Each of these rules represents a small frustration for an individual user.

**But Apple doesn't break just one. And they don't have just one user.**

The problem can be expressed in a formula:

> Minor wastes & frustrations **x** hundreds of millions of users   
**=** _design crisis of epic proportions._

In other words, Apple's design choices harm the user. A lot. At a massive scale. Worse, Apple sets the trend.

## There's nothing wrong with minimalism.

But that's not what Apple is shipping. Apple is shipping maximalism in denial. Taking away all the visual cues that would make that maximalism usable.

You can strip the hardware to bare simplicity, as long as the software can pick up the slack; you don't need a physical back button if the software is consistent. You don't need a physical alarm clock with dials and switches, if its software replacement is simple, forthright, logical.

But it isn't.

**Minimalism in software is achieved by _simplifying feature sets_, not _stripping away pixels_.**

In software, affordances are everything. And all affordances are made of pixels. It's not _minimalism_ to rip away the very things your users need.

It's _sadism_.

## The direction of iOS 7, 8 and 9 is simply _wrong_.

This is not an aesthetic argument. It's wrong based on 40+ years of computer-human interaction research. It's wrong based on 30+ years of Apple HIG.

And it is even more wrong to apply these same designs to the desktop, where both screens and input devices differ.

The result of this confused software-as-hardware approach are predictable:

  * increased user error
  * increased user uncertainty and anxiety
  * increased cognitive overload
  * wasted time, energy, effort, and confusion
  * loss of productivity, money, and… love 

These are the effects of a philosophy of [digital brutalism](http://cheerfulsw.com/2010/dont-listen-to-le-corbusier—or-jakob-nielsen/).

We are seeing these effects already. And, as you've seen, they add up.

## Jony is not single-handedly responsible for this.

But he's the most powerful design leader inside Apple, and it's his job to fix it.

This design trend is a backslide of epic proportions, but it's not unsalvageable.

There is a war now between aesthetics and function, but _it doesn't have to be this way_.

## Jony, you hold all the cards.

And where you go, so goes the entire software design industry.

**Please don't allow visual design trends to destroy Apple's -- and Steve's -- legacy of excellence in interaction design.**

Please, bring back Apple's legacy of _usable_ design innovations, and strong human-computer interaction.

Please, fix this.
