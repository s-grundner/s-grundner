Welcome to Primate Labs' iPhone, iPad, and iPod benchmark chart. The data on this chart is gathered from user-submitted [Geekbench 3](http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/) results from the Geekbench Browser.

[Geekbench 3](http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/) scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 2500 (which is the score of an Intel Core i5-2520M @ 2.50 GHz). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.

If you're curious how your computer compares, you can [download Geekbench 3](http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/download/) and run it on your computer to find out your score.
