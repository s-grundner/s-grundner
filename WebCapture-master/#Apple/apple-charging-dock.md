Need a stylish dock for all your Apple things? This project is for you. It's a 3D printed rapid charging station for your iPhone 7, AirPods, and Apple Watch. The soft inserts for each product are press-fit so they can be changed out to fit a new version of each product if need be.

## Step 1: Tools + Materials

### 3D Printer

  * 3D Printer
    * I use a [Creality CR-10](https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_441281.html?lkid=11217563). It's the best bang for your buck, in my opinion.
    * Use this coupon code at Gearbest to get it for $339: 1111CR10
    * You'll need to modify the CR-10 to use the polyflex PLA (or any soft material). Here's a youtube video on how to do that: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ0h3_vNpno>
  * 3D Print Filament
    * I used [Matte Fiber HTPLA](https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/new-releases-favorites/products/matte-fiber-htpla-white) from Proto-pasta for this project, but pretty much any filament will work. I like this stuff because the finish looks really good.
    * I used [Polymaker Polyflex](http://www.polymaker.com/shop/polyflex/) for the rubber feet. This stuff is good for this application because it creates more friction on a desk top to keep the sign from sliding around.

### Parts

  * [M3 Screws](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y3TY2FB/?tag=instructabl09-20): $13 for 260 pc.: You could use any screws and nuts around this size, but I find these work well for small 3D printed mechanical projects.
  * [100 Point Chipboard](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E69QMHA/?tag=instructabl09-20): $1.50 / sheet: This is used for the three panels and the sign panel. You can cut it with a straight edge and a hobby knife.
  * [USB Multi Tap](https://www.portableuniversalpower.com/product/usb-multi-tap/): $45: This is a 4 port, 3 amp rapid charger made by Hardened Power Systems in Tennessee. I've tested it and it's more than 50% faster than the 5 amp Apple charger at charging my phone. At $45, it's hard to beat the price, and I always buy from small local guys whenever I can. 
  * [Powerpole Cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1VVN11/?tag=instructabl09-20): $9: This is how you connect the Multi Tap to the DC terminal. If you have a crimper you can just crimp your own wires with powerpole connectors.
  * [12V 7A AC /DC Adaptor](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0113NPC0K/?tag=instructabl09-20): $14: Any 12V adaptor will do, but you'll want one that's got a high amperage output to take full advantage of the multi-tap. Technically you'd need 12A to get top performance out of the multi tap (3 amps X 4 ports), but it seems really unlikely to me that the watch and the EarPods would pull 3 amps.
  * [Lightening Cables (2)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010S9N6OO/?tag=instructabl09-20): $8 ea.: Any generic cable will probably do, this one works with the files I designed.
  * [Apple Watch Cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BN15LQ/?tag=instructabl09-20): $28: It's important that you use this model or one that's the same size, bigger ones won't fit.
  * [USB Extension Cable](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CJG2ZYM/?tag=instructabl09-20): $5: I added this as an extra USB charging output
  * [5.5mm x 2.1mm DC Jack Connector](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XQGQT2Q/?tag=instructabl09-20): $7: This connects the powepole cable to the AC adaptor. 

### **Software**

**Fusion 360** is free and it's awesome. I use it for everything I design and fabricate.
