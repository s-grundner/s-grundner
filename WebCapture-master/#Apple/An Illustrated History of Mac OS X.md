## Cheetah

### 03 / 2001 â OS X 10.0

The history of OS X started with a bear, not a cat: in September of 2000, Apple presented **Kodiak**. For 30$, users could _purchase_ this first public Beta of Mac OS 10.

The official OS 10.0, Cheetah, followed 6 months later. It featured Apple's brand new user interface **Aqua** and the first versions of apps like **TextEdit, Preview, Mail, and QuickTime**.

The new OS X demanded an (at that time: whopping!) **128 MB of RAM** and 800 MB of disk space.

## Puma

### 09 / 2001 â OS X 10.1

Just half a year later, **Puma** was released. Instead of delivering many new features, it focused on improving the system's **performance**.

With Mac OS 10.1.2, Apple also started shipping OS X by default with new computers - and replaced OS 9 for good.

## Jaguar

### 08 / 2002 â OS X 10.2

**Jaguar** featured new applications like **iChat** and **Address Book**. It also introduced **Universal Access**, a component that made OS X more usable for people with visual and hearing impairment or physical disability.

Besides that, OS 10.2 showed a new startup screen: it replaced the **Happy Mac** logo with the new, fruity Apple icon.

4

![Panther](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/04-panther%402x.png)

## Panther

### 10 / 2003 â OS X 10.3

Microsoft must have had mixed feelings with **Panther**: on the one hand, _Internet Explorer for Mac_ was superseded by the new **Safari** as the default web browser. On the other hand, 10.3 brought many **interoperability** improvements with _Microsoft Windows_ (including out-of-the-box support for Active Directory).

Additionally, Apple presented **ExposÃ©** to improve working with multiple open applications.

5

![Tiger](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/05-tiger%402x.png)

## Tiger

### 04 / 2005 â OS X 10.4

**Tiger** brought the invaluable **Spotlight** search to Mac OS. It was also the first version to present _Widgets_ (like a calculator, a calendar, or a clock) on the new **Dashboard**.

Besides that, Mac OS 10.4 inaugurated new hardware: it was installed both on the first Macs with **Intel processors** and on the first **Apple TV** devices (that were yet to come out later, in 2007).

6

![Leopard](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/06-leopard%402x.png)

## Leopard

### 10 / 2007 â OS X 10.5

No other Mac OS had been such a long time in the coming. However, Apple had been busy developing and releasing iOS and the iPhone in the meantime...

The new **Leopard**, anyhow, introduced a built-in backup system called **Time Machine**. It also brought full support for **64-bit** applications.

Moreover, Mac computers could now run other operating systems like Microsoft Windows - thanks to **Boot Camp**.

![Snow Leopard](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/07-snow-leopard%402x.png)

## Snow Leopard

### 08 / 2009 â OS X 10.6

Like the name suggests, **Snow Leopard** built mainly on top of its predecessor, Leopard. However, it introduced the new **Mac App Store** that was inspired by its successful companion on iOS.

Mac OS 10.6 also marked the end of the PowerPC architecture. Only Intel-based Macs were supported from this point on.

8

![Lion](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/08-lion%402x.png)

## Lion

### 07 / 2011 â OS X 10.7

The king of all cats, **Lion**, was the first version of Mac OS that wasn't available on CDs or DVDs anymore. The exclusively downloadable OS picked up many ideas from iOS: **Gestures**, **Launchpad**, window restoring, ...

Apple's newest part of infrastructure, **iCloud**, also debuted in Mac OS 10.7.

9

![Mountain Lion](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/09-mountain-lion%402x.png)

## Mountain Lion

### 07 / 2012 â OS X 10.8

**Mountain Lion** brought even more successful concepts from iOS to the Mac: a new **Messages** app to replace iChat, the **Reminders** app, and the **Notification Center**.

Even before presenting OS 10.8, Apple made a big announcement: it committed to a **yearly release cycle** for new versions of Mac OS.

10

![Mavericks](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/10-mavericks%402x.png)

## Mavericks

### 10 / 2013 â OS X 10.9

With **Mavericks**, Apple didn't only introduce a **new naming scheme** for its operating system. It also made OS 10.9 a **free upgrade** and promised to keep future updates free, too.

New applications like **Maps** and **iBooks** were also presented with Mavericks.

11

![Yosemite](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/11-yosemite%402x.png)

## Yosemite

### 10 / 2014 â OS X 10.10

The biggest **design change** in years, Mac OS 10.10 follows its little brother iOS - with a flatter appearance and blurred transparency effects.

With the new **Handoff** functionality, users are able to move seamlessly between devices, even during individual tasks. Apple also emphasizes its **Full Screen Mode** feature: it's now triggered through the traditional green button in the window title bar.

12

![El Capitan](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/content/posts/53-history-of-osx/12-elcapitan%402x.png)

## El Capitan

### 09 / 2015 â OS X 10.11

**El Capitan**, named after a rock formation in Yosemite National Park, concentrates on **performance & stability** improvements.

Besides some smaller enhancements to Safari, Spotlight, Mail, and Notes, the introduction of **Split Views** is probably the biggest novelty: a way to conveniently arrange two applications' windows side-by-side.
