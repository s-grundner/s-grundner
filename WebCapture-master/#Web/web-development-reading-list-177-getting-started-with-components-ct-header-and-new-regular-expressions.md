From time to time, we need to take some time off, and actually, I'm glad that this reading list is a bit shorter as the ones you're used to. Because one thing that really stuck with me this week was Eric Karjaluoto's article which states that "**taking pride in how busy we are is one of the worst ideas we ever had**." So how about reading just a few articles this week for a change and then take a complete weekend off to recharge your battery?

  * The next major release of Angular, [Angular 4.0](https://angularjs.blogspot.de/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html?m=1), is now available. It's smaller and faster than it's predecessor and ships flat ES modules.

  * There's a new security header called `Expect-CT`. Scott Helme explains [when and how you should use it](https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-expect-ct/).
  * I bet many people here have a Samsung TV. And while there are currently not many phones out there from this vendor that run on Tizen, a lot of TVs do. Now, [security researchers have found some quite interesting things](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/smart-tv-hack-embeds-attack-code-into-broadcast-signal-no-access-required/) about [Tizen's security](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/samsung-tizen-operating-system-bugs-vulnerabilities), including vulnerabilities that can give full access to the device and ways to embed malicious code into the system through the app store.

  * In the past, we tended to teach people to use a VPN if they wanted to stay secure. But now we know that by far [not all VPN services have good intentions](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/phony-vpn-services-are-cashing-in-on-americas-war-on-privacy). Some even inject advertising and privacy-leaking data into your network requests or sell your history to third parties.
  * Nicolas Bevacqua wrote about [regular expressions in a post-ES6 world](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/regular-expressions-post-es6), including the new Unicode flag, the matchAll function, and assertions.
  * Eric Karjaluoto shares [why we need to slow down](http://blog.officehours.io/slow-the-fuck-down/), and why taking pride in how busy we are is one of the worst ideas we ever had. What if the best thing you can do for your career -- and life -- is to press pause, set your number one priority, and then rethink your way of working?

_And with that, I'll close for this week. If you like what I write each week, please [support me with a donation](https://wdrl.info/donate) or share this resource with other people.
