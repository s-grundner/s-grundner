After a thorough research, our [web app developers](https://www.valuecoders.com/web-app-developers.php?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=webapp-dzone&utm_campaign=SMEs) at ValueCoders gave me the insights about the upcoming Web Application Development Trends in 2018. Out of them, here are selected 7 trends that might interest you.

### 1) Helpful Chatbots and AI (Artificial Intelligence)

Chatbots make things easy for e-commerce developers as they develop websites with appropriate online assistance. It allows their users to order food, tickets, and more with just one click. In fact, it is predicted that approximately 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without any human assistance by 2020.

Advanced chatbots based on artificial intelligence will play an important role in the coming years as they are able to understand live speech and are constantly learning. For instance, eBay uses a chatbot in Facebook Messenger for its communication process.

### 2) **Motion UI**

This could be one of the most amazing web application development trends in 2018. Motion UI keeps a site simple, as a large number of web users get tired of GIFs and flashing advertisements. So, web developers design websites with moderate design as it will get maximum appreciation. Through this, you can add a new life to your minimalistic website.

Sophisticated motion UI is considered to become popular soon. Here, animations will allow web developers to add styling and make your site unique among thousands of others with static UI.

### **3) Blockchain**

It is the most effective method of collective data storage. There are a huge number of computers around the world which have a lot of information stored on them, and all of this data is decentralized. Blockchain provides a high level of security in this case. The main advantage is that there are no intermediaries between transactions. Every transaction is verified and relies upon complex algorithms, even when a large number of computers are already participating.

Moreover, many multinational banks are considering using blockchain technology in their systems in order to ensure full security to their data.

### **4) AR (Augmented Reality)**

AR is an easy, quick, and interactive web application development trend. On mobile devices, it helps marketers to reach their target audience. So, all social audiences will be integrating AR into their platforms. For instance, Snapchat has opted for an AR feature which allows its users to add their Bitmoji and project it via the phone's camera.

Moreover, brands can also project their products through special filters into the homes of social media users.

### **5) Single-Page Websites**

A single page website is a long, scrollable page which provides full information of the respective site to its users without moving towards any other web page. Hence, it saves website visitors from complex navigation, tons of text to read, and multi-level menus. However, these types of websites are not meant for e-commerce. But, these are useful for mobile websites, as the user don't have to jump over other pages in order to collect important information.

Moreover, these are user-friendly websites. It provides many business benefits by reducing the cost of website designing, web application development, and web hosting. These websites are beneficial to businesses as it brings an impressive increase in conversions.

### **6) **Progressive Web Apps

Progressive web apps are websites similar to native mobile apps and they work offline. Hence, they deliver an amazing user experience. It is expected that in 2018, PWAs will be the major competitor to native mobile apps. A progressive web app loads instantly and it has the ability to work without any WiFi connection. That's why it is going to be a true web application development trend.

PWAs are most famous for their UX. Some giants like Flipkart and The Washington Post have made PWAs of their websites, which has significantly improved user engagement and conversions on all platforms.

### **7) Push Notifications for Websites**

It is an amazing and unique web application development trend for which[ eCommerce developers](https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-ecommerce-developers.php?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=ecomm-dzone&utm_campaign=SMEs) are widely accepting. Since mobile apps notifications are highly efficient for user re-engagement, it is expected that it will also benefit the businesses to a great extent. This will allow users to be further notified of any type of changes on the website, even when they are not actively on that site.

However, the major benefit of using push notifications for websites is that you can keep your users highly engaged without any big effort.
