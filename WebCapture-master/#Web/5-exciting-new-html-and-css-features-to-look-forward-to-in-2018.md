HTML and CSS are always evolving, offering front-end devs and web designers a lot of new possibilities. Today, let's have a look at 5 really exciting new HTML and CSS features for creating better websites in 2018.

## Native <dialog> Element

Released along with the new HTML 5.2 spec in December 2017, the `<dialog>` element offers the possibility to create native dialogs in pure HTML.

As of January 2018, `<dialog>`[only works in Chrome/Chrome mobile](https://caniuse.com/#feat=dialog).

## CSS Scroll Snap Points

CSS Scroll Snap is a recent module of CSS that introduces scroll snap positions. These determine the specific positions that a container's scrollport may end at after a scrolling operation has completed.

This feature is unfortunately [not yet implemented](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-snappoints) in most browsers.

In the example above, a series of images arranged in a scroll container is used to build a photo gallery.

It is taken from the [W3C working draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/), make sure to take a look at it for more info about this exciting new functionality.

## Inline CSS in <body>

The new HTML 5.2 specification has made inline CSS style in the body a valid practice. Not the most exciting new feature, but this could be a real relief in several cases.

## Variables

[CSS preprocessors](https://www.catswhocode.com/blog/8-css-preprocessors-to-speed-up-development-time) have offered variables for a long time. Still, I'm very excited about the idea of native variables in the CSS spec.

CSS variables are pretty well implemented and will work perfectly in [most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables). More info can be found on the [W3C page](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/).

Now, here's a quick, self-explanatory example of how to use native CSS variables:

## Support Queries

As seen with the previous features I wrote about, browser compatibility is still always a big problem when it comes to using new CSS features.

The relatively new `@supports` feature provides developers a way to condition rules based on whether particular property declarations are supported in CSS.

`@supports` is [currently supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries) by all browsers except Internet Explorer 11.

For an in-depth look at the feature, I recommend you read this [interesting article](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-css-supports-rule-feature-queries/).
