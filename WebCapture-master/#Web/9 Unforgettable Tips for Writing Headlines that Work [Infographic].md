When you battle for attention in the noise fest that is the Internet, the most important skill you could possibly possess is headline writing. Your headline is going to be the make-or-break element that determines whether or not your content is read.

I want to help make you a better headline writer.

I've created a cheat sheet you can use to hone your headline writing. It's ultra-simple - I've spelled out 9 tips based on the word 'HEADLINES'. I've made it an acronym, a memory device. Each letter is one of the 9 tipsâ€¦ easier to remember, right?

## **The most important line you'll write for your blog post or any type of content is the headline**

Advertising pioneer David Ogilvy once reported only 1 in 5 will make it past your headline into your copy. Though I don't have a modern day update on the percentage, I suspect, given the immense volume of content available to the active web surfer of today, the percentage of readers that click through to your story is far lower.

In an [article from SEO technology company Conductor](http://www.conductor.com/news/5-data-insights-headlines-readers-click), they report:

> _"A day in the Internet shows that 2 million blog posts, 294 billion emails, 864 thousand hours of video are created daily. Each day also brings 400 million tweets. (From 2013)"_

That's a lot of competition for your attention. The obvious result is tons of great content is ignored. Your challenge is to quickly engage readers and inspire clicks with headlines that suggest your articles are useful.

In an effort to help you understand a variety of headline approaches that perform well for bloggers, I've created a **cheat sheet that spells out nine tips for writing headlines that work based on the word H-E-A-D-L-I-N-E-S.**

Following each tip, I offer two examples. The first example comes from ideas for a would-be blog about pets (simply because my cat and dog are loving on each other as I write this). The second example draws from my area of expertise, online marketing.
