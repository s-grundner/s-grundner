Note 17 October 2006

Corporate design manuals, CSS, information architecture and object oriented
programming follow the same principle. They are modular.

I am currently reading a book on information design that makes me clap my
hands every 5 minutes. Unfortunately it's been published in German only (so
far). The book is about scientific findings about human perception and what
these findings mean for the screen designer. Cool stuff.

> Congruency of system elements among different form criteria: It all becomes
obvious when looking at corporate design manuals. They describe in detail,
which elements are part of the visual identity, how they're applied and how
they may or may no be combined. In order to achieve a closed and homogenous
impression, the once defined elements are meticulously coordinated. The same
tendency towards precisely defined elements of order becomes more and more
obvious in modern information systems. This is partially due to the more and
more increasing complexity, but also with the possibility, to define different
variations of visual order of information in advance. â€”Systemic Design -
Intelligent surfaces for information and interaction, p. 28 _(my translation)_

Which, in simple English means: Corporate design manuals are modular.
Information technology is modular. They're both modular because modularity is
the only way to deal with complex information such as corporate design for
multinationals or thousands of lines of code.
