As part of our standard project best practices, we work with [many clients](https://south.io/case-study/) to help them get their on-page SEO in order -- an effort that covers a lot of ground, from link-building to developing diverse, relevant and continual content.

The "right" way to go about search engine optimization will differ based on your business and site goals. But as far as on-page SEO goes for your site, there are a few things everyone should do to present themselves as professionals in Google's eyes.

Here's a step-by-step checklist to get your site search-engine optimized. They're bucketed into technical and non-technical tasks, and in my subjective order of priority.

If you like checking things off (I do!), **use ****[this Google Sheet**](https://goo.gl/0nxvOr) to keep track of the tasks.

#### 1\. Verify Your Mobile Friendliness

Google recently rolled out tests to use your mobile website -- and content contained within your mobile site version -- as the primary version to crawl, index and use in their RankBrain algorithm. This means your mobile site content helps determines your organic rank.

For example -- if you only have 40% of your desktop content on your mobile site/version, then you are at risk of losing the potential value of the other 60% if Google does not utilize this desktop-only content.

We also suggest[ a mobile audit](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/) to ensure your website complies with Google's Mobile Standards best practices.

#### 2\. Optimize Your Page Speed

With Google's push for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), they've made it clear that page speed is important for search rank signals. Better page speed can also help with onsite metrics like lowered bounce rates and increased time onsite, which can both play into ranking signals.

We'd recommend trying to get your aggregate site speed to less than 3 seconds. Here is a [hands-on tutorial](https://magazine.getelevar.com/ecommerce-site-speed-optimization-what-i-learned-857c80cf99e7) to help perform your own onsite performance audit.

#### 3\. Switch Entire Site to HTTPS

Google recently announced in 2014 that secure URLs are used as a light ranking factor signal. Ensuring your site is served through fully secure https pages is recommended. Just watch out for potential performance side effects -- like cache -- that are in place to help ensure your site is snappier but can sometimes be in place for http only.

#### 4\. Ensure Your Product, Category, Blog, or Page Title is Wrapped in an H1 Tag

Header tags continue to be an important part of a foundational SEO strategy. While Google doesn't come out and say <h1> tags boost page rank, there are plenty of data points validating this and showing strong results supporting the use of <h1> tags.

The thought is that these help guide search engines through your authoritative hierarchy of terms you should rank for.

#### 5\. Remove Modals from Mobile

You've probably heard this (too much) by now: Don't include "intrusive" pop-up modal windows on your mobile site when a user first visits otherwise you'll risk a [penalty](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/08/helping-users-easily-access-content-on.html).

A robots.txt file should be used to direct and throttle crawling where necessary. For example, 404, and private URLs should not be indexed and should have an exclusion within your robots.txt file. Learn [how](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en).

Bonus: Ensure your staging website blocks all indexing with a disallow all robots.txt file to prevent accidental indexing.

#### 7\. Verify Sitemap.xml File

Verify you have proper sitemap.xml files in place for all content types generated from your website -- and that they're being updated daily. Also submit all sitemap.xml file(s) in your Google Search Console. See ours [here](https://south.io/sitemap_index.xml).

#### 8\. Use Canonical URLs

We want to ensure that all pages have a canonical tag set to the preferred URL. This helps inform search engines what page should be considered the authoritative URL if you have duplicate URLs with similar content (including http/https).

#### 9\. Implement Structured Data

Ensure that you have structured data (aka rich snippets) in place for all content and article pages.

At the minimum, these rich snippets can help improve click-thru rates on search results, which can lower paid search costs and (maybe?) help natural lift in your page rank.

#### 1\. Improve Page Title Tags

The closer your target keyword is to the beginning of the title tag, the more weight it has with Google/search engines. Make sure your page titles contain content rich-keywords that match the content on that page. This shows up as the blue line in search results, as well as on your browser tab. It's the first thing readers may see about your brand, so make it interesting -- and true.

These should also be 60 characters or less, and unique for each page on your site. An ideal structure: _Top Keyword, Any Secondary Keywords or Modifiers| Your Brand's Name._

#### 2\. Use Short and SEO-Relevant URLs

Your page URLs should contain primary content keyword(s) close to your page title. When a user looks to your URL, it should be clear not only where they are on your site, but also the topic of that page. Make sure it's concise, clear, and speaks to the subject of your content.

URLs should also be as short as possible (i.e., don't include dates).

_Bad Example:_ south.io/lab-154/becoming-your-consumer-and-producing-under-pressure-e8e4fef6573d/version-1/2016-11-25

_Good Example: _south.io/case-study/autodesk-our-connected-futures

_Great Example:_ south.io/on-page-seo-checklist

#### 3\. Implement LSI Keywords

These are basically synonyms that Google uses to help determine relevancy for searches. For example, if you have a page for "Best Fishing Rods", you might want to consider including the year or brands in content within the page if you aren't already:

> _find these related searches at bottom of search results pages_

Try implementing a few of these into your page content as well!

Your <meta> tag descriptions should contain a content-rich explanation of the page and Call-To-Actions (CTAs) that match the content. Your Meta Description is what shows up below the title tag on the search engine results page. While these aren't as _directly _important to SEO ranking factors anymore, they _do_ help with users actually clicking thru to your site -- and click thrus help with ranking.

Think of meta descriptions as ad copy. Explain what's on the page, be compelling, and be accurate. You don't want the user to click thru only to find it's not what they wanted (negatively impacting your bounce rate). Each page should have its own unique description.

Keep Meta Descriptions shorter than 155 characters to avoid search results page truncation.

#### 5\. Start Using Video and Media

Video, podcasts, infographics, creative graphics etc can all help enhance your on-page SEO. These can help increase potential for sharing, appearing on image or video searches, and increasing the total time on your page/site (i.e. engagement).

Test the waters by implementing these on a few pages and compare trend differences between pages that do not have these to help determine any measurable lift.

Outbound links can help search engines hone in on the topic of your page. [Backlinko](http://backlinko.com/) recommends 2-4x quality outbound links for every 1,000 wordsâ€¦and they've done loads of research that I trust.

The same goes for inbound links -- link to 2-3 other relevant pages of your own on every page!

#### 7\. Set Image Alt Tags

All site-wide images should have alt tags, which match the content of the banner (be sure to include one that contains your target keyword as well).

The alt and title attributes of an image are commonly referred to as alt tag, alt text, or title tag even though they're not technically tags. The alt text describes what's on the image and the function of the image on the page. This will help with ADA compliance as well.
