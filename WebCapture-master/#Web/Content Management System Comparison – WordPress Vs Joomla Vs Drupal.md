## 18 Jun Content Management System Comparison - WordPress Vs Joomla Vs Drupal

These days many people prefer to use a content management system for [building a blog](http://www.setupablogtoday.com) or website as it makes it a lot easier for people with no web design experience to make minor changes to the website such as adding blog posts, uploading new images or making small edits to your key pages.
