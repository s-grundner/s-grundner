Another popular news source for tech junkies, The Next Web also has an interesting backstory. It began back in 2006 when its founders Boris and Patrick were in search of the perfect tech event to promote their latest startup. When they couldn't find a suitable event, they decided to host their own. In that process, they also came to the realization that they needed a platform on which to promote their event, thus The Next Web was born. That platform became a blog and eventually grew into the major tech publication that you know and love today.

TechCrunch is one of the best news publications for learning about the latest and greatest startups, many of which, of course, are made possible only by the complex and often cumbersome work developers put in to build the innovative foundations for today's tech startups.
