You may not have heard of SEO burnout, but chances are you or someone you know has suffered from it. Common signs and symptoms include sweaty palms at the mere mention of "rankings"; a gnawing in the pit of the stomach when you realize your search traffic has unexpectedly dropped; or the loss of interest in activities you usually find enjoyable (e.g., optimizing your blog posts for the search engines).

**Here's a real-life example of what can happen if you don't treat SEO burnout appropriately (courtesy of Reddit user [self.SEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/)):**

"Is anybody else sick of SEO? I've been doing it for three years and I am so f****** bored. I've had a lot of success with it, but I just get so sick of reading the articles about Google's next update and talking to people about their rankings. Marketing companies say "We are passionate about SEO." How can you be passionate about it? Does SEO really excite you?"

**If this little "self-talk" scenario sounds familiar you, you're not alone.**

The good news is that while there's currently no _cure_ for SEO burnout, there are steps you can take to mitigate its effects, and possibly even reignite your passion for all-things-SEO.

**Here goes!**

## 1\. Spend some quality time with your first love - your analytics.

Your website analytics are the foundation of your SEO strategy. They'll tell you how much search traffic you're getting, which pages or posts are performing best, and which content needs some help in the SEO department.

I find that spending some time just poking around my analytics tends to reenergize me, and reminds me why I ever cared about SEO in the first place.

This is particularly true when looking at my _conversion rates_. There's nothing like seeing a drop in conversion rates to remind me why SEO matters.

## 2\. Take a (short) break from your SEO

If spending time with your analytics doesn't help (or makes your burnout even worse), it may be time to take a short break from anything related to SEO. This means no obsessing over traffic, no reading up on the latest Google updates and no re-optimizing old content in a desperate attempt to rank.

While you shouldn't leave your SEO on autopilot for _too_ long, sometimes a brief break can be just the trick. After a couple of weeks, you may just find yourself itching to get back at it with renewed energy.

## 3\. Spend time doing something you love

Since most SEO tasks are completed online or at least on a computer, I recommend taking some time to do something offline that you enjoy. Jogging (or strolling), going out for dinner, playing with your cat (I'd choose my dog, but you get the idea) - it doesn't matter. Just make sure it's something you love (and bonus points (we must track everything) if it's a guilty pleasure).

I find it's often when I'm doing something I enjoy that I get new insights about my business, website or SEO strategy. This then gives me the motivation to get back at it and make things happen.

## 4\. Network with other business owners or search marketing professionals

Sometimes surrounding yourself by people who are excited and passionate about SEO can be contagious. Hearing them talk about their latest SEO strategies or successes can be just the medicine you need to cure (or at least treat) your burnout.

Search marketing conferences, local networking groups, and even just informal business lunches can be a great way to get inspired and get back on track.

## 5\. Vow to work harder in less time

A common cause of SEO burnout is simply spending too much time completing SEO tasks. When you do this, it's not uncommon for SEO to start invading your non-work-time thoughts and dreams - and this is never a good thing.

I'm sure you've already heard of or read Tim Ferriss's [4-Hour Workweek](http://fourhourworkweek.com). While running a business in four hours a week isn't doable for most business owners, the techniques he recommends are all about being as efficient as possible in the time you have.

Decide how much time you're going to spend on SEO, then stick to it. Set a timer, put it in your calendar, have an accountability buddy - it doesn't matter. Just be sure you don't let SEO take over your life.

## 6\. Go back to the basics

SEO burnout is more likely to happen when you let things get overly complicated. While the technical aspects of SEO are certainly important, if you're feeling burnt out, it's probably time to go back to the basics (for now).

So, what are the basics? I'd say start with some basic [keyword research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2016/06/14/the-5-components-of-a-modern-keyword-based-strategy/#3871b2293366) and on-page optimization of your content.

First, look for popular keywords and phrases you know you can write great content around. Use those keywords as a starting point to find a general theme for your content, as well as related topics and subheadings you can incorporate.

Then use these keywords in your title tag, headings, URL and throughout your content. This stuff is relatively simple, yet can still reap huge rewards. That's a surefire fix for burnout.

## 7\. Spend time with your audience/target market

I find that when I start to lose touch with what my audience wants and needs, burnout often starts to set in. It starts to become all about rankings, optimization, and traffic, instead of people, problems and solutions.

Focus on creating excellent, helpful content that's well-optimized and well-promoted. Even if you do this - and nothing else - you're likely to see a boost in traffic and rankings. And that's always great for keeping you motivated.

## 8\. Outsource your SEO

Assuming you're not a professional SEO or search marketer, your burnout may be trying to tell you something: namely, that it's time to let someone else take the SEO reigns so you can focus on running your business.

SEO can be time-consuming and highly technical, and sometimes you just need to bite the bullet and [outsource it](http://ppc.org/7-reasons-why-outsourcing-seo-is-a-good-idea-for-a-small-business/). This will free you up to focus on the parts of your business you love and actually feel passionate about.

## Final thoughts

If you're struggling with SEO burnout, you're not alone. Most business owners and even professional SEOs and marketers have been there at least once (usually more). Fortunately, it won't last forever if you take steps to mitigate its effects.
