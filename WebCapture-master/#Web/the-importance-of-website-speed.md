Website speed is an extremely important determinant of your website's success in 2017. It's no longer a luxury, but a necessity. If you want to add more elements to your website, make sure you are not sacrificing your website speed -- otherwise, you might be losing more than you may gain. Benefits of faster website page load times can't be denied.

In this article, I will tell you how website speed helps you out and why should you invest in your website's speed. I'll analyze some evidence rather than simply state opinions.

Before moving on, I would like to quote some facts and figures about website speed:

> "47% of consumers expect a website page to load in two seconds or less." -- Innovation Insights   
  
"40% abandon websites that take more than three seconds to load." -- KISSmetrics   
  
"A one-scond delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions." -- Econsultancy   
  
"If an eCommerce site is making $100,000 per day, a one-second page delay could potentially cost you $2.5 million in lost sales every year." -- Amazon 

The above facts come from some of the most authoritative sources; we can surely believe them. Still not convinced? Here are some of the benefits of having a faster website page load time.

## It Helps SEO

If you don't care about SEO and organic traffic, you can always choose to ignore this. However, if you really want your website to rank highly, then increasing your website speed should be your next goal. Google has come a long way since it was launched, and it now considers hundreds of factors for ranking a website.

In 2010, Google announced that website speed would be taken into consideration for ranking websites.

When Matt Cuts (Google Webmaster Offical ) was what his main SEO strategies would be if he were hired by a company for SEO, he named increasing website speed as one of his main goals.

Not only does it contribute directly to your website ranking as a factor, but it has a strong influence on a couple of other ranking factors. Google recently incorporated bounce rate, average time on site, and CTR into their ranking factors.

  * **Average time on site: **As it appears from its name, this is simply the time in seconds that a visitor stays on your site before deciding to leave.

  * **[Bounce rate](https://blog.crazyegg.com/glossary/bounce-rate/): **The percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.

  * **[CTR](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-ctr-defining-click-through-rate-for-online-businesses/):** The ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.

So, how are these factors impacted by page speed? Let's demonstrate.

A person comes to your website and finds it takes around eight seconds to load. The person will probably leave your site right away without even looking into the content of the current page (forget about navigating another page on your website!). It will impact two of Google's important factors: bounce rate and average time on site. There is quite a chance that the person will remember your website name and will avoid visiting your website in the future, resulting in a decrease in CTR.

Additionally, Backlinko research found a [strong correlation between a website's speed and its ranking in search engines](http://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking).

We can easily conclude that website speed is an important determinant of your website SEO success.

## Better UX, More Sales, and Better Customer Loyalty

No one likes to wait long for a web page to load. Fast website speed is essential for good UX. Would you like to browse a website for some time that takes more time to load than it takes for your egg to boil? Obviously not; and your visitors are no different.

If it's taking too long for your website to load, there is a probability that your visitor -- whether they're a new user or existing customer -- may go back and choose one of your competitors. It could overall result in a lot of loss of your sale and customer loyalty.
