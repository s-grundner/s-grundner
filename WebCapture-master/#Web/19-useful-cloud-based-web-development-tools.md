> _Online Playground for Web Developers_

Web app development consists of many elements that require a developer to possess knowledge in many different areas. Almost every web app uses a database to store information, that's why a web developer should have SQL in his or her tool kit.

Going further, you can build app logic using various languages such as Python, Java, PHP, or Ruby. To handle the visual side of things, a developer will likely utilize a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render a nice looking web application.

To get familiar with this diverse technology stack, web app developers can make use of such as the ones described below.

  1. **[SQL Fiddle**](http://sqlfiddle.com/) is the perfect online tool to test queries and to compare and contrast SQL statements in different database back-ends. Installing each database often requires some effort, especially when we want to check the effect of the query in different environments. On the left pane of the SQL Fiddle application, you can create tables, views and other database structures and additionally insert some test data, while SQL statements can be inserted in the right-hand panel.
