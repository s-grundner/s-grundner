Many companies try to create a great experience for customers. But few are willing to make the changes required to deliver on that promise. In fact most don't even realize just how bad their experience can be. This is why we made a new book called "User Experience Revolution," a **practical battle plan for placing the user at the heart of your company**.

When did you take your last **vacation**? For many of us, it was probably a long time ago. However, since quite a while, I stumble across more and more stories about companies that take unusual steps vacation-wise. Companies giving their employees a day off each week in summer or going on vacation together as a team building event instead of traveling somewhere just to work.

But while there's a **new generation building their dream work environments**, a lot of people still suffer from very bad working conditions. They work long hours and are discriminated or harassed by colleagues or their managers. And just this week, I heard that many company owners are desperate because "Generation Y" doesn't want to work long hours anymore.

As with every major break in generations, I think it's good to have people standing up for their rights, enjoying their life and their work. But we also need to talk with executives who are under pressure to match deadlines. Because only if we show them evidence that working less can be beneficial for their employees' health and productiveness, we can convince them to let us work more freely.
