# What is HTML?

HTML is a **Markup Language**. Markup are small annotations that editors make to a document that let the publishers know how to format certain text. Perhaps the heading is bold with a Times New Roman font. The Editor makes marks on the page to let the publisher know how to format the text.

HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a markup language that tells a web browser how certain text should be formatted.

The way HTML tells a computer how to format text is by surrounding the text with a **tag**.

# What is a Tag?

A tag is just like a label. The tag has an abbreviation for the name of the type of formatting it represents.

Surrounding text with a bold tag makes it bold.

~<b>~This text is bold.~</b>~

Each tag has to be opened and closed. A forward slash in front of a tag name specifies the end of the tag. Tag names go between the less than and greater than signs.

If you wanted to underline some text:

~<u>~This text will be underlined.~</u>~

And, if you wanted some text that is underlined to be bold:

~<u>~This Text will be underlined also, but ~<b>~this text will be bold and underlined.~</b>~ ~</u>~

So yea, you can have tags within tags.

And that is the basics of HTML.

# Examples

~<i>~This text will be italic.~</i>~

~<hr>~
*This is a horizontal rule/line. It does not need a closing tag. A tag that doesn't need a closing tag is called a "self closing" tag.*

Another tag that is self closing is the break tag:

~<br>~
 
*The break tag is like hitting the ENTER key. It puts a space between sections. Browsers don't automatically detect spaces unless HTML tells them there are spaces.*

~<textarea>~This is a text area. Tap inside to edit the text.~</textarea>~
