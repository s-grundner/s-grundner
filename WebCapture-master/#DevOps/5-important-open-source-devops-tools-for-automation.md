Open-source programming can enable improvement and add flexibility in dealing with changing markets and needs. Visibility into the code improves general quality and security and empowers relationships to evade merchant lock-ins from prohibitive dealers.

Automation tools are very important for automating test scripts and to achieve speed and the agility. This entire process is known as DevOps automation.

Today we shall discuss five important open-source DevOps tools for automation, but before we do, we need to address five reasons you would require automation tools:

  * Monitoring

  * Log analytics

  * Source control management

  * Container management

  * Configuration management

In order to resolve each one of these issues, you have specialized open-source tools:

## **Icinga for Monitoring**

Icinga is an open-source monitoring tool created as a fork from the famous [Nagios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios) monitoring app (also open-source). The result was a best-in-class monitoring instrument with a multithreaded plan, high accessibility groups in-built with a distributed setup, and better adaptability for joining with modules, plug-ins, and various outside services.

**Best Features and Benefits**

  


**Enterprise Pricing and Support Plans**

  


Modularity, giving you a chance, to begin with, the core item and add UIs and modules to suit your requirements

Free to utilize, circulate, and modify

  


  


  


A REST API for quick reconfiguration of Icinga monitoring by different applications, utilizing the famous "monitoring as a code." This is like several other DevOps ideas, similar to "infrastructure as code"

Icinga accomplices offer proficient help contracts from section level up to 24/7 undertaking support; pricing option is available per partner basis.

Support for all real design administration frameworks, including Chef

  


## **Elasticsearch for Log Analytics**

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine equipped for solving a growing number of use cases. In DevOps, the framework and system log information can be rich wellsprings of data, fault correction, and execution change when investigated appropriately. Elasticsearch internet searcher and analytics innovation is joined with Kibana for the UI and Logstash for information collection. Together, they form an open-source trio for broad log analytics.

**Best Features and Benefits**

**Enterprise Pricing and Support Plans**

Elasticsearch gives appropriated search and analytics platform, with RESTful incorporation into DevOps

The three modules can be downloaded complimentary

Kibana offers information representation, making log information and examination more natural for people

Paid help accessible with four levels, from basic levels to big budgets

Logstash brings far-reaching ingest, change, advance and yield functionality to gather and send log information to the Elasticsearch engine

  


## **GitHub for Source Control Management**

GitHub is a development platform driven by the way you work. At the core of [GitHub is Git](https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/what-is-git/), an open-source project for programming version control. Git is distributed, as opposed to more customary forms of control frameworks. Clients roll out improvements on their local installations of Git then "check them in" by interfacing with the principal server. GitHub adds highlights to Git: for example, a web graphical interface, upgraded access control, and collaboration.

**Best Features and Benefits**

  


**Enterprise Pricing and Support Plans**

Share the progressions you make to other individuals' product by forking to duplicate a repository to take a shot at, at that point sending a forced demand to the store proprietor to blend your progressions.

Free to use for public and open-source projects, paid plans for private storehouses

  


  


  


  


  


Trigger prompt coordinated effort, by essentially mentioning a colleague in the Issues and Projects segment that goes with each code venture.

Entry-level $7 per client every month, up to business-level $21 per client every month with day in and day out help for pressing issues.

## **Docker for Container Management**

Docker is the world's most popular open-source container platform. A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable programming cluster. The container incorporates the code, runtime versions, framework apparatuses, framework libraries, and settings expected to run the product. This enables clients to maintain a strategic distance from issues caused by various setups of a basic working framework on various servers.

**Best Features and Benefits**

**Enterprise Pricing and Support Plans**

Limits RAM and hard disk use, giving you a chance to run more software per given hardware resource

Docker Community Edition (CE) for no charge at all with excellent network support.

Automates setup and arrangement, making it simple to bundle programs for use anytime in the DevOps procedure

  


Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) accessible as a membership benefit beginning at $750 per node every year, with programming, support and certification.

## **Chef for Configuration Management**

Chef is an open-source administration device that permits framework administrators and clients to convey programming configurations to various servers. Chef can be used as a component of a CI/CD pipeline, offering an "infrastructure as code" approach.

**Best Features and Benefits**

  


**Enterprise Pricing and Support Plans**

  


Scales to deal with deployment up to a large number of servers or more, on its own.

Available for download at no charge and as paying facilitated versions.

Gives clients a head-start with a current library of standard framework designs in Chef "formulas" and "cookbooks"

  


Hosted evaluating examples: $72 per hub every year with 99.9% uptime SLA, $137 per hub every year for consistent automation for high speed IT.
