What is the future of software development and deployment? DevOps processes have helped take developers and operations folks out of their silos and share responsibilities.

But is it enough? Many companies still need to learn the steps to adopt DevOps for their teams and across the enterprise.

Attend [The Future of DevOps](https://praecipio.com/pc/display/ae/2017/04/25/The+Future+of+DevOps+%7C+San+Francisco%2C+CA) in San Francisco on June 14 to learn more. It's a free event at the Keystone in San Francisco, with special guest presenters [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/) CTO Abbas Haider Ali, [BigPanda](https://www.bigpanda.io/), and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).

## Future of DevOps 2017

DevOps remains an important part of competing with best-in-class companies. In a [2017 survey with Atlassian measuring the maturity of DevOps](https://www.xmatters.com/resources/reports/devops-self-assessment-survey), 65% of companies who are practicing DevOps say they are experiencing the benefits they expected.

In the same survey, around 60% either didn't know what it was, or weren't sure if their companies were doing it. So there is still a gap between companies doing DevOps, and companies who still consider it a buzzword. For the 41% embracing and practicing DevOps, they have a strong competitive advantage over their peers in the market.

Development and operations have become a continuum instead of separate processes.

Now operations are taking responsibility earlier, resolving issues during development before they can reach production and affect customers. And developers are extending their roles to managing code in production and resolving issues, again before they can affect customers.

The most advanced DevOps companies are constantly testing in production and even introducing errors to challenge their ability to resolve issues before customers are affected.

Getting started on this journey is challenging. How will you do it? With BigPanda, a leading monitoring tool, and Splunk, an information intelligence tool, you can find out about issues. Leading tools from Atlassian help perform service desk functions and perform important issue tracking and collaboration activities.

Here's a quick look at how xMatters, Atlassian, and Splunk work together to resolve issues.

xMatters shares information across systems and tools and automates collaboration. The relevant people get data in context in their systems so they can take immediate action.
