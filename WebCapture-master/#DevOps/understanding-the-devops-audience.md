# Understanding the DevOps Audience

_Captured: 2017-05-16 at 20:10 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-the-devops-audience?oid=twitter&utm_content=buffer6f7b9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)_

DevOps encompasses a wide range of job roles and functions. From software developers to information technologists and quality assurance professionals to project managers, targeting the DevOps crowd can be a challenge due to its mixing bowl of an audience.

Because DevOps covers configuration management, infrastructure, documentation, quality assurance, project management, user experience, and more, the types of developers, architects, and analysts looking for DevOps articles, tools, and resources varies.

In preparation for our upcoming [Guide to DevOps: Continuous Delivery & Automation](https://dzone.com/guides/devops-continuous-delivery-and-automation), we surveyed the DZone audience and found that:

  * Java is the primary programming language at work (65%)

  * Majority of team sizes range from 2-5 people (31.8%) to 6-10 people (31.8%)

  * Development / engineering (42.1%) and developer team leads (26.8%) are the primary DevOps roles

  * DevOps professionals are seasoned, with just over half of them (53%) having 10-20 years of IT experience

  * 81.3% are working on web applications / SaaS and 50.7% are developing enterprise business applications

Another interesting tidbit is how these software, IT, and QA developers/engineers learn and hone their skills.

Online classes/training (69.2%) and articles on various tech sites (85.7%) are the top ways this group likes to learn.

Tip: Create your own set of training or educational materials on various DevOps techniques to appeal to your audience's desire to learn. Or, write a few quality articles on your blog to share your industry expertise.

## DevOps Executives on DevOps

DZone Research Analyst, [Tom Smith](https://dzone.com/users/1450207/ctsmithiii.html), recently spoke with 16 executives on the state of the DevOps movement in 2017. His findings, while currently published in the [DevOps Zone](https://dzone.com/devops-tutorials-tools-news), are also featured in the Guide to DevOps.

Here's who he talked to:

Michael Schmidt, Senior Director, [Automic](http://www.automic.com/) | Amit Ashbel, Director of Product Marketing & Cyber Security Evangelist, [Checkmarx](http://www.checkmarx.com/) | Sacha Labourey, CEO and Founder, [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/) | Samer Fallouh, V.P. Engineering and Andrew Turner, Senior Architect, [Dialexa](http://www.dialexa.com/) | Andreas Grabner, Technology Strategist, [Dynatrace](http://www.dynatrace.com/) | Anders Wallgren, CTO, [Electric Cloud](http://www.electriccloud.com/) | Job von der Voort, V.P. of Product, [GitLab](http://www.gitlab.com/) | Charles Kendrick, CTO, [Isomorphic Software](http://www.isomorphic.com/) | Craig Lurey, CTO and Co-Founder, [Keeper Security](http://www.keepersecurity.com/) | Josh Atwell, Developer Advocate, [NetApp SolidFire](http://www.netapp.com/us/products/storage-systems/solidfire/index.aspx) | Joan Wrabetz, CTO, [Quali](http://www.quali.com/) | Joe Alfaro, V.P. of Engineering, [Sauce Labs](http://www.saucelabs.com/) | Nikhil Kaul, Product Marketing Manager Testing and Harsh Upreti, Product Marketing Manager API, [SmartBear Software](http://www.smartbear.com/) | Andi Mann, Chief Technology Advocate, [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/)

Key insights from his interviews:

  * **Focus on productivity, collaboration, and automation.** Continuously work to automate infrastructure. You need an overview of the process and collaboration.

  * **Testing has become a more important part of the process.**

  * **It's important to understand that DevOps is not a product, it's an implementation of a manufacturing process that relates to technology.** DevOps principles are applicable throughout the industry. This reduces uncertainty and improves efficiency of process management.

  * **To be successful, we need to listen to operations as well, going beyond the tools, to understand what's important.** DevOps is driven by developers and the tools developers like.

  * **DevOps is becoming everything - development, operations, security, testing, and deployment. **We are going to see employees become more versatile - multi-skilled "jacks of all trades" instead of "master of one".
