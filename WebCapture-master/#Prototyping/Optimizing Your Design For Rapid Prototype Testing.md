  * Standard UI elements
  * Focused mockups on the one thing you want to test
  * Any elements that add credibility to the product
  * Stakeholder interests that are not relevant to the test
  * Variables that are not being tested
  * Anything that distracts the user from what you need to learn

By focusing almost exclusively on the user insights that each test is designed to yield, prototype testing can be an impressively efficient method for product teams to run experiments. While complex prototypes might be helpful to the engineers, leaders and other stakeholders who want to play with and celebrate a completed product design, they'll only weigh you down if your goal is to solicit user feedback as quickly as possible.
