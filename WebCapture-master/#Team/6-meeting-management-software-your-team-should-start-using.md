_Captured: 2018-06-11 at 21:14 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/6-meeting-management-software-your-team-should-sta?edition=381206&utm_source=Daily%20Digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily%20Digest%202018-06-11)_

In America, 55 million meetings are conducted on a weekly basis, whereas the total number of meetings held annually in America surpasses well above a billion. That's right, America meets a ton!

That means more than a quarter of the total time of an average American working in an organization is spent attending meetings. In 2017 Cisco reported that 37% of employee time is spent in meetings.

How much of that total time spent in meetings is actually productive?

According to a [report by Attentiv](http://attentiv.com/america-meets-a-lot/), 63% of the total meetings held annually are conducted without an agenda. Goes without saying, ill-planned meetings lead to ill-achieved outcomes.

[Planning your meeting](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/why-unplanned-meetings-are-harmful/), managing it and then conducting it strategically to achieve a solid outcome from the meeting is all part of meeting management.

Modern workforces have automated their traditional meeting platforms into virtual meetings, with the use of meeting management software.

Meeting management software has been a tremendous help in enabling teams to achieve myriad of goals within a cost-effective approach. However, even the modern methods of conducting meetings have their downside: patchy network, technical issues and choppy video, to name a few.

Which is why we have gathered a list of 6 best [meeting management software](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/product/meeting-management-software/) that your team will most definitely enjoy meeting within.
