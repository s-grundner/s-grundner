# Project Team Principle #2: Delivering fast and furious value

_Captured: 2017-08-03 at 08:46 from [adamonprojects.com](http://adamonprojects.com/library/articles/the-nine-teaming-principles/project-team-principle-2-delivering-fast-furious-value/)_

We need to ensure that the project moves forward at the desired rate, and delivers real value to its customers.

This needs to be a clear expectation for every team member.

Have you worked with teams, who had little idea or interest in the result, delivering solutions to customers? Where they also didn't know what the customers were paying for or how much value was going to be produced for the customer? In those situations, it isn't surprising that the delivery efficiency was not very high because their role was primarily delivery assurance: to make sure that something was eventually delivered, not to maximise the delivered benefit to the customer.

This sort of complacency is all too common in organisations. We need to create a "**sense of urgency**", and to do this we need to focus on three elements: value, speed and passion.

More information can be found in [Project Action Principle #1](http://adamonprojects.com/project-management-principles/project-action-principle-1-achieve-outcomes-rapidly/) and in [Project Action Principle #2](http://adamonprojects.com/project-management-principles/project-action-principle-2-enable-customer-value-interactively/).

## Value, speed and passion

There are three elements to a successful final outcome from the project team:

### Value:

The team delivers outcomes that are expressed in terms of value for the customer. Projects that are not value-focused tend to lose direction because they do not have a clear and tangible goal. They often get lost in the constraints of the chosen technologies and/or the complexity of the delivery process.

### Speed:

Get it done, now! Not only does the customer want the benefits as soon as possible, but the team deserves the opportunity to succeed.

**"If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough." Mario Andretti (retired Italian American world champion racing driver)**

This is as critical is from the start of the project to the very end. Speed and urgency should not only be applied near the finish line or when things go wrong. If there is lag in the early stages of the team formation, there will be problems getting the project completed on time because the effect will usually be multiplied downstream.

**There is no greater, but unacknowledged, risk to project delivery than the duration of project execution - Adam Russell.**

The longer the project is in flight, the more likely it is to get zapped by some major event: re-organisation, change in strategy, funding issues, market downturn, etc.

### Passion:

Be passionate! Why are we doing this if not to do it well, generously and fully? Passion comes from commitment and/or from a delight or enjoyment in the subject matter. This passion generates energy, which assists with speed.

## Finding the barriers to value, speed and passion

### Value:

Try this simple test to see how knowledgeable and aligned you are. Write down 25 words or so that describe the customer value that your project is delivering. Then ask your team mates the same, and compare all the responses.

Very few project teams (excluding the business leads) will describe their project objectives in terms of the problem that they are trying to solve. In an Agile team, the probability is much higher. But many Agile methodologies, like Scrum, still intermediate between the team and the end-customer via the Product Owner.

### Speed and Passion:

Speed and passion ultimately go together, but if you are in a team or organisation with an emphasis on internal values, metrics and processes, speed and passion are hard to generate. You will hear things like: "this is how we do things around here" or "what's the point in busting a gut, the executives will only change their minds in a few weeks."

## Generating Speed, Value and Passion

This is the kind of knowledge that can only come from direct engagement with the customer's situation. Once a person can feel the customer's pain and has empathy for the customer's situation, they are more likely to develop a commitment to resolve that situation.

The more committed a passionate team is, the less likely they will focus on blockages and potential problems. It's easy to be distracted by issues when people don't really believe in the outcome.

Passionate team members "suspend disbelief" in their ability to overcome difficulties in future tasks and are more likely to back themselves to achieve difficult goals. This attitude builds the pace of the project, and brings intermediate goals sooner.

This clause ensures that the project moves forward at the desired rate, and delivers real value to its customers.

**_I understand that this project team has been formed to deliver value to some person or organisation, who I will think of as my customer(s)._**

**_I commit to developing an understanding of this value to the customer and to fostering this value in my day-to-day activities. I commit to defining the value of my work in terms of end-customer's needs. _**

**_I will work to encourage a continual focus on the end-delivered value. I will make it a personal responsibility to understand and empathise with that value in the way that our customer(s) see it. Because it is not just the responsibility of the project manager or business lead._**

**_Our team has an obligation to get our project done as quickly as practicable, and as inexpensive as we can manage to meet the optimal capabilities. All cost/time/value trade-off decisions are not ours, but our customers. _**

**_We do not have a right to extend the project arbitrarily, to opportunistically expand work to spend approved budget, or to consume an agreed amount of time._**

## Next Steps

What are your thoughts on the objective of this clause? Do you have any suggestions for modifications to the wording?

Following on from the article outlining my [five Project Action Principles](http://adamonprojects.com/project-management-principles/), this article expands the second Principle:

> _Project Action Principle #2: Fulfill Customer Value, Interactively_

**Any activity, resource investment, or outcome that does not service a customer value proposition is waste and probably avoidable. The definition of value must be obtained directly from the customer, not an intermediary. Project deliverables must be repeatedly and directly validated with customers_._**

## A project delivery problem?

Some have said a fanatic is "someone who, having lost sight of their goal, redoubles their efforts". This quote is often on my mind when I see projects facing difficulties. The problem is that teams rarely step back and re-orient themselves against the end-goal. Too frequently, project goals evolve as teams progress: customer goals become system goals, then system goals become departmental goals and so forth. These disconnects drive customer assessments further and further from where the work is being done..

In some cases this separation happens quickly, even before early decisions are made on project outcomes and delivery strategies.

I once told my VP that many of the project delivery problems he was seeing in our large portfolio were actually project selection problems. We were managing projects that had little chance of succeeding, were technically flawed, or did not service a customer value proposition. He flatly disagreed and continued to direct our efforts towards process and methodology solutions to perceived project management problems.

But I was right: many problems that appear in project execution are actually problems in project selection and definition, and the most common problem is not being aligned with a customer value proposition.

Projects rapidly evolve to operate in in terms of its system structure (an engineering framework) and the delivery process (. a project management framework). This often throws up conflicts or unexpected options that can be hard to resolve

These system or delivery conflicts can be resolved by reference to a well-defined customer value framework. How does that work?

## Definition of a customer

It is not useful to differentiate between internal and external customers, as is common in many discussions about value.

The differentiation is between customers who makes a choice to invests resources to obtain an outcome that enables something in the customer's environment, and those who do not: who perhaps receive outcomes based on operating budgets or otherwise do not have to invest in the outcome.

In order to solve a real customer problem, the customer has to value the result: to have "skin in the game"

## Definition of customer value

It is amazingly sad how many projects talk about creating customer value, without actually engaging customers. Almost everyone expects that a project will be delivering to customer needs, but it's a lot easier to write that into the project documents than to do it.

Projects so often base their objectives on indirect sources of customer views, out of date information, and assumptions

This create enormous problems for projects attempting to deliver a product.

Even projects that do focus on customers and their problems often fail to fully understand this concept. The principle danger is to accept at face value what customers tell you without seeking the bigger, higher or deeper purpose that truly identifies what the customer is looking for.

"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." - Henry Ford

Whilst that may have been literally true, and a cute quote, it was Ford's job to unpack customer demands and find what problem the customers wanted solved, not what they stated on the surface.

The value proposition for customers is not framed by the deliverable of a project or even what they do with the deliverable.

The definition of customer value is what the product will enable the customer to do or do better. It's critical to your project success that you understand the purpose of the deliverables; This will provide you with the strongest guidance to shaping project activities.

## What do customers want? It's not features

A few years ago I was managing a major mobile app product development. The product manager's existing documentation was mainly high-level market research and long lists of application features. All of the initial scoping and planning discussions were framed by the feature list with practically no considerations to target users, their specific problems and / or their intended usage.

At the initial meeting with our User Experience (UX) Architect, again this feature list was the centre of the discussions, until the UX guy asked them "What user problem are you trying to solve?" There was a fairly blank look from the Product Managers and a prolonged silent pause until one managed to blurt out, "Isn't it obvious?" And back we went to the feature set.

Customers don't want a product because of what it can do; they want it because it helps them do something that that's important to them. It helps them solve a problem in their lives, or enables them to be great at something that they like to do.

**"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole." Theodore Levitt**

In reality, even a quarter-inch hole doesn't enable anything in people's lives. What they want is what they can do with the quarter inch hole, like putting up shelves or hangers; and so on.. You can expand this thinking further, looking for a higher value context, and I will provide more detail on that technique in a separate article.

Many product managers still think in terms of features: faster performance, cleaner interface, or richer features. Don't fall into the trap of talking about "customer value" in a solution language: get to know the problem, understand your customer, and discover what they are trying to solve.

## Direct customer contact

Direct customer involvement in the project is a must-have for success. It is the foundation upon which all subsequent outcomes are based. This concept is core to Agile, Lean development and related methodologies, but many projects still believe that they can do this at a distance from the customer.

Getting direct, sustained and interactive engagement with actual end-customers is typically hard to achieve. Key team members may feel that it is not necessary, that it is time-consuming or that no new information will come about.

Direct customer involvement can be challenging. It can generate information that doesn't match our desires or expectations, or may be hard to interpret. Alternative sources of information are easier to obtain: prior market research, individual domain expertise, and "branded" Industry research (e.g. Gartner).

As a compromise, many projects use "proxy customers" (e.g. product managers or SME's, market research, industry studies, etc.). But beware of this approach, even "proxy customers" need to get their insight from actual customers. Considering caring for a sick child: should the doctor give medical treatment to the proxy (i.e. parent or guardian) or the child?

There is no substitute for direct, interactive customer involvement.

## Embedding a Customer Value perspective into your project

You should consider one of the earliest outcomes to achieve is agreement on "what customer problem does this project solve". Don't let the project move past this outcome under any circumstances, no matter how often someone tells you that they know better.

Never stop engaging the customer, or encouraging your extended team to build their understanding of the customers in bigger, higher and deeper contexts. Your processes and plans need to ensure the engagement of customers in your project delivery. Never mind what this is called: "Lean" or "Agile" or whatever. Customer validation activities need to be built into your end-to-end project plan. You need to have a strong User Experience architect involved in your project, at some level.

If you ever lose sight of these two "commandments" of customer value, then your project is headed for some bumpy roads ahead.

## Conclusion

Never forget two fundamental lessons about customer value:

  * Customers decide what is valuable to them, not individuals in the product development company or any other participant in the product value chain; and
  * Customers are not interested in your product. They are interested in what your product enables them to do or accomplish.

Bring these two core lessons to each and every day, every interaction, and use them to drive every aspect of your project management planning and execution.
