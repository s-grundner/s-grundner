What would you choose when you decide that a change in development process is necessary, when you realize that the [Waterfall](https://www.bizitbridge.com/blog/category/waterfall) methodology is too inefficient? Probably you'll have to choose one of the [Agile](https://www.bizitbridge.com/blog/category/agile) methodologies, most likely between [Kanban](https://www.bizitbridge.com/blog/category/kanban) and [Scrum](https://www.bizitbridge.com/blog/category/scrum). Alright, but which one is the best?

My opinion, always expressed like this, is to "choose the vehicle which fits your culture!". This is always the best possible choice.

  * Scrum will bring to your organization a fundamental shift; Scrum will leverage team commitment as Change Agent;
  * Kanban will bring to your organization incremental improvements; Kanban will leverage Work In Progress (WIP) limits as Change Agent;

Because it's easier to be implemented, Kanban could be the first choice, before implementing Scrum. Anyway, both of them being Agile methodologies, for sure they will bring you the needed change in organization.
