How many times have you heard people arguing about which one is better - Kanban or Scrum? Probably a lot, especially if you are in the product development business. This argument is not new and you can hear it at pretty much every business summit that puts together people who are doing software development.

If you search Kanban vs Scrum in Google you will find various articles, white papers and research on the matter, which will sweep you of your feet if you take the time to read them in depth. However, they won't be able to give you the most essential information about what exactly the two methods are and how they compare at a glance. We like to keep things clear and simple, so after hearing the argument for the millionth time, we decided to bring you all the important information about the two methods - synthesized and visually appealing. This way, you can decide for yourself whether Kanban or Scrum is a better fit for your company. Before you get to the interesting part we would like to be clear that both of the methods are great and adopting either one will get you far.
