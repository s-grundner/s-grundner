1\. The focus on finishing the most valuable work and getting it to our customers rather than starting a lot of tasks that may stall, be abandoned, etc.  
2\. Giving the business a clear picture of what we are doing, how the work has been prioritized, what may be stuck, and where our constraints are.  
3\. In our case, Kanban makes each phase of work more explicit - you can't get to the next phase without completing x,y,z, and it says so right on the board.  
4\. It's flexibility. We frequently try to tweak/adjust details of our processes within Kanban; if something helps us to deliver quality software more quickly, we keep it; if it doesn't, we abandon it.  
5\. It encourages speed and efficiency.

To Sum it up, Kanban is a low impact tool in terms of adoption as it can layered on top of your existing process without significant change.

Kanban has been used to great success in manufacturing, for example, Toyota. There is also great successes happening in health care, education, and even the video games industry.

You start your Kanban journey by exposing your current working practices, good and bad so that everyone can see the real situation. Once you have got into the swing of visualizing your practices, you can then make a more informed choice when you decide to evolve your process.
