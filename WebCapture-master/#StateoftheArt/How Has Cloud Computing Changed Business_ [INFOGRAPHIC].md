We have long been advocates of [moving business operations into the cloud](http://mashable.com/2010/09/06/business-infrastructure-google-account/). The remote access, cost-savings and organizational benefits alone make it a no-brainer.

The data they distilled might surprise you, and it's all packed neatly into the infographic below.
