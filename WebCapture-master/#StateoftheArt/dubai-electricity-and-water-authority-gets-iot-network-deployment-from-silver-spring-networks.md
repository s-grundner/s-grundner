Silver Spring Networks has announced the initial successful deployment of its multi-application IPv6 network canopy at the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA).

The Dubai-based public service infrastructure company's network canopy extends throughout the Emirate of Dubai and is based on Silver Spring's Gen5 technology, which is said to offer high performance, reliability, security as well as scalability.

In addition, Silver Spring's Gen5 technology has been integrated into Honeywell Elster's smart meter devices to connect the first DEWA electric customers to its IoT canopy. The infrastructure modernisation efforts initiated by DEWA support the Smart Dubai initiative, which aims at transforming Dubai into the most innovative smart city in the globe.

HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD & CEO of DEWA, said: "DEWA is pleased with its progress for the second smart initiative, Smart Applications through Smart Meters and Grids, in alignment with the UAE Vision 2021 and the Dubai Plan 2021, which enables DEWA to build a wide and integrated smart grid covering generation, transmission and distribution systems. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Silver Spring Networks to bring the company's proven Internet of Things technology to DEWA customers, first through smart electric services and beyond into other smart applications, which can help contribute to making Dubai the happiest and most innovative city in the world."
