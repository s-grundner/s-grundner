# Everything you Need to KnowAbout the Golden Ratio

The smart people know about this by now. If you don't, find out about it sooner than never.

And if you are a designer, The Golden ratio (Divine proportion) is a concept, you must be familiar with to get aesthetically right and appealing designs. Knowing this concept will play a major role in getting established due to its wide range of successful usage over several years and the sense it puts into your design.

**What is "The Golden ratio"?**

This is special number was encountered by an equation where a line is divided into two parts. The longer part divided by the shorter part will be equal to the length of the whole line divided by the longer part, confused? See below, this whole calculation can be depicted in a form of an equation as,

(Golden ratio -- Wikiwand)

**A/B = (A+B)/A = 1.6180339887498948420** â€¦

It's symbolized by 'phi' (21st letter of the Greek alphabet). Resembling [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) to a great extent, (if you go back to school mathematics lessons or The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown), the Golden Ratio is known to delineate a perfectly symmetrical relationship between two particular proportions, explained above.

This concept can also be demonstrated by using a large GOLDEN RECTANGLE consisting of a square with edges of equal lengths similar to the shortest length of the rectangle and a small rectangle. To proceed with, once you remove this former square from the rectangle, there will be a remaining portion of smaller Golden Rectangle. Surprisingly, this step can be continued INFINITELY, similar to Fibonacci numbers which works in just the opposite way.

Drawings on rocks and caves carry an evidence about the use of Golden Ratio for over 4,000 years! Some historians have suggested that this principal has also been used by Ancient Egyptians in building Pyramids, so here lies the secret of every marvel our eyes pop out at.

During the ultra-modern days, the pertinence of this concept was used as the basic inspiration in almost every stratum of art which are widely accepted by people all over the world. The most famous examples for such include master pieces of Greek architecture and the famous drawing 'Last supper'.

Interestingly, The Golden ratio concept has been vastly observed everywhere in nature around us, especially on flower petals, sea-shells (snail shells, nautilus shells), seed heads, tree branches, pineapples, spiral galaxies, DNA molecules, animal bodies, on honeycombs and even human body, that's almost in everything! It's a magic figure.

**How to construct a Golden rectangle?**

The basic creation of the golden rectangle is very simple and has an extensive application.

**Here are the steps:**

1\. Draw a square, which will form the shorter-edge of the rectangle we are going to form

2.Divide the square in to two equal parts with a vertical line.

3.Choose one rectangle and draw a diagonal line joining one corner with the opposite.

3.Rotate this new line, so it will appear horizontally adjacent to the initially drawn rectangle.

4.Finally, create a new rectangle by using this horizontal line with one vertical edge acting common to both the initial and new rectangles.

Now that the basic structure is formed, you can make necessary alterations and adjustments for creating the necessary design, according to the requirements and guidelines.

The easy way

**Have you ever heard of something called 'Rule of Thirds'?**

This is a concept created where a certain area is divided into three equal parts both horizontally and vertically, so that the lines of intersection will ultimately give rise to a natural focal point in determining its fundamental shape. This basis is used by most of the [photographers](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/golden-ratio-photography/) in capturing delightful compositions by placing the key subject on one of these lines of intersection, and focusing on it, thus enhancing the perfection of its virtual identity. Moreover, designers can use the same principle can be used in page layouts, web interfaces, mockups, and poster designs.

Application of this principal to a rectangle will give an outcome similar to that of a golden rectangle, creating a satisfactory and pleasant creative.

Before concluding the article, we thought of making you aware of few applications available in the cyber space, which will ease the usage of this golden ratio precisely and more creatively in your day today design work.
