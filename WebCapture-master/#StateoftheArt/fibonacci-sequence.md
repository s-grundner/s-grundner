# Fibonacci sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:

> 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144…

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

#### In nature

The Fibonacci appears everywhere in Nature, from the leaf arrangement in plants, to the pattern of the florets of a flower, the bracts of a pine cone, or the scales of a pineapple. The Fibonacci numbers are applicable to the growth of every living thing, from bees to single cells…even in the veg we eat for dinner. The photo above is from some Broccoli (Brassica family) I ate.
