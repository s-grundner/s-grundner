# What you need to know about Big Data

_Captured: 2017-10-13 at 16:35 from [www.infineon.com](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/discoveries/big-data/)_

People and machines generate unimaginable amounts of data - currently 16.3 zettabytes per year, a number that will grow tenfold by 2025. "Big data" is an extremely valuable resource that is changing the way we communicate: We divulge ever more information about ourselves. There are advantages and disadvantages to this trend.

During your lunch break, you pull out your smartphone and check various apps to see what you missed. You order something from an online shop at the spur of the moment, because you just received a push message telling you that the price of the skiing helmet you're interested in has been heavily reduced. What looks like a coincidence is actually the product of advanced math, analytical skills, and targeted marketing, in other words, applied big data.

Around the globe, people and machines produce vast amounts of data around the clock - in Internet browsers and social networks, while driving, when paying by credit card, during online shopping, while making calls on their smartphones, and much more.

At the same time, cameras monitor our cities, smart metering systems measure power consumption, stock market transactions are carried out on computers, medical devices record health data, and connected cars are linked to the Internet.

#### Big data in real life

Big data is defined by three main characteristics: volume, diversity, and speed. Growing digitization means a constant rise in the volume of data at an ever increasing speed. We currently produce and record 16.3 zettabytes of data each year. A zettabyte is one billion terabytes. By 2025, this number will increase to 163 zettabytes, according to a study conducted by IDC and Seagate. Written out in full, that number looks like this: 163,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.

Entire server farms are needed to reliably store this vast amount of data. Energy-efficient semiconductors from Infineon ensure that the costs to [supply power to these server farms](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/applications/power-supplies/server-power-supply/) are significantly reduced.

In the future, the data volume will be measured in yottabytes, a number with 24 zeros. This rapid growth is also related to the increasing diversity of the data. In the beginning, digital data was mostly in the form of numbers and documents. With the invention of the Internet and digital cameras, photo, audio and web data was added. And ever since we've had mobile phones, smartphones, YouTube and Netflix, mobile data and information from social media and streaming services have also entered the picture. Now, devices that are part of the Internet of Things, like fitness bands, smart thermostats and connected cars, are additionally feeding this ocean of data.

Another thing that has changed from the early years of the digital age is the speed with which the data can be accessed. First it was pooled, then it was periodically compressed, and now it's available in real time.

But initially, all this data is merely collected information. It becomes usable only when it's processed quickly and analyzed correctly. This is where big data offers advantages and disadvantages. But for whom exactly?

Big data plays an important role in more and more areas of our daily lives. Scientists use data to examine climate change or the occurrence of earthquakes and epidemics. Government agencies and intelligence services comb through huge data volumes to find anything conspicuous that might reveal terrorists. We collect content data, metadata, transaction data, behavioral data, health data, financial data, measurement results and monitoring data. This data is of interest for the stock market, nuclear physics, regional transport, telecommunications, market research, energy supply, insurance companies, retail chains, the automotive sector, criminology, anti-terrorism, and marketing.

Data from the present is used to make forecasts for the future. This is where big data analytics comes into play, also referred to as data mining.

Intelligent algorithms are needed to bring order to this chaotic flood of data, because big data has to become smart data: It simply starts out as immense quantities of data. But that are no use to anyone unless they've been analyzed. Only then does the data become high-quality data. The aim of the algorithms is to detect patterns and statements that are then interpreted and evaluated by analysts. Companies use this approach, for example, to identify and fix weak points in production. That may give them an edge over the competition.

Companies benefit from this data collection and analysis, as noted by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems. That's because

  * more real-time analysis leads to optimized workflows and hence more efficient management.
  * Personalized services can be offered when systems turn masses into people with individual needs.
  * Products with preinstalled big data intelligence process data independently and pass it on.

#### Benefits for consumers

Big data always has two sides: One that produces the data and another that analyzes and uses it. Industry and science benefit from big data. But what price do the users pay whose data flows into these analyses? There are two aspects to this: Firstly, consumers are often unaware of how carelessly they divulge information and what it can be used for. Secondly, they are often not asked for their consent to use the data.

Date of birth in connection with their place of residence, device identification of their smartphone, cookies in the browser, IP addresses, chat and text messages, and their own posts and profiles in social networks: Smart tools add up all this information and turn it into a comprehensive picture of each individual. Even if data records are anonymized, they can easily be assigned again to the original persons. What remains are highly "transparent" users. And they are then classified into categories, for example, by insurance companies and banks before they sell a policy or issue a loan, or by employers looking for new people to hire.

Whether with or without data protection guidelines, big data will become even bigger in the future. Data is the gold of the future. The efficiency of data analytics will continue to improve, and more and more companies will rely on data analysis to keep up. Specialists who analyze and interpret data correctly will be in even more demand.

Algorithms for facial reconstruction already exist, making it possible to compare profile pictures from social networks with a medical MRT image. We will also soon see the first text mining algorithms that can assign sentences in Internet forums to a person. The trend is toward combining big data with artificial intelligence. Robots and machines are being programmed to learn independently ("machine learning"), thus allowing them to rapidly process data themselves and respond to it. Connected cars and autonomous driving are examples of this.

Also on the rise is "contextual awareness" on mobile devices. Apps analyze specific information and then know what the user needs next. For example, when the user types in a customer's name, the device instantly brings up all previous e-mails and appointments with that business partner, or offers to call them.

Big data provides users with a host of benefits and new possibilities. The challenge lies in seizing these opportunities, but without losing sight of the risks. This is where users themselves can help by handling their own data with care and caution.
