# How VCs Are Cracking The Code On Millennials

Rightly or wrongly, Millennials have become a popular target for a wide array of generalizations. They've been called products of a [terrible economy](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/we-millennials-lack-a-roadmap-to-adulthood) and the "[go-nowhere generation](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/the-go-nowhere-generation.html?_r=2&src=me&ref=general&)"; they're seen as [distrustful](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/), [competitive](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21660110-businesses-should-beware-dubious-generalisations-about-younger-workers-myths-about), lazy, and [narcissistic](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/we-millennials-lack-a-roadmap-to-adulthood), as well as [confident, self-expressive, and open to change](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/). Whatever you choose to think about Millennials, however, at least one thing appears certain: they are the unbridled [tech generation](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/).

**So What Does This Mean For [Tech](http://www.forbes.com/technology/) VCs?**

From meet-and-greets to careful firm branding, tech VCs in Silicon Valley have developed plenty of strategies to best engage with Millennial entrepreneurs. And for good reason. Born anywhere between 1980 and 2004, Millennials have never known life [without the Internet](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/can-millennials-make-technology-entrepreneurs/)--and after coming of age during a challenging job market and soaring levels of student debt, many have been forced to fashion their own opportunities using their tech savviness. Ask any of the young founders behind Stripe, Zenefits, Box, Mixpanel, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, Pinterest, Instagram, or Teespring.

In Palo Alto particularly, it's become increasingly common for VCs to volunteer as guest lecturers, judges, or mentors at Millennial-targeted competitions and events, solely to meet and network with budding entrepreneurs. Many VCs have also shifted into social media and blogging to extend their reach to younger audiences. And still other VCs have hired Millennials part time to serve as their eyes and ears on college campuses, resulting, for example, in [First Round Capital](http://firstround.com/)'s[Dorm Room Fund](http://dormroomfund.com/)--a collegiate venture fund investing in student-run companies in cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia.

Other VC firms have made bold marketing and hiring moves. [Rothenberg Ventures](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2014/07/09/vc-millennials-rothenberg-ventures/) - founded by 31-year-old Mike Rothenberg - explicitly positions itself as "the Millennial venture capital firm." [Meritech Capital Partners](http://www.meritechcapital.com/), meanwhile, snatched 28-year-old partner [Max Motschwiller](http://fortune.com/2015/03/09/max-motschwiller-leaves-kleiner-perkins-for-meritech/)from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to hone on similarly young entrepreneurs.

**VC Programs Target Millennials**

Below we highlight two very different firms - one a larger, well-established, elite institution, and the other a next-generation micro VC - both of which are devoting meaningful resources to connect with Millennial entrepreneurs in unique ways.

Even a firm as impressive and entrenched as [Greylock Partners](http://www.greylock.com/), which often has its first pick of startups, has done much to cater to younger entrepreneurs--starting with the hire of a dedicated university liaison, [Julie Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jderoche).

Since joining Greylock's talent team in 2012, Smith's role has evolved from helping Greylock portfolio companies recruit out of colleges to implementing and overseeing multiple programs designed to meet students' needs. Programs like [Hackfest](http://greylocku.com/hackfest/) (now in its fifth year) attract some of the best computer programmers to compete in coding competitions, where winners are chosen by Greylock partners and select founders of Greylock portfolio companies. While there is a monetary prize, first-hand access to the judges (and the bragging rights) are worth far more.

Another Greylock-sponsored program is [Techfair](http://greylocku.com/techfair/), an invite-only job fair for top engineering talent. Attended by roughly 50 technology companies each year, Techfair exposes students to select tech companies well in advance of the fall interview cycle, and in return, provides companies with an early look at a prize pool of Bay Area candidates. It's a win-win for both sides, and by making the fair uniquely productive and fun, Greylock forges relationships (and good will) with the best and brightest students to enter the business.

Greylock X, an under-the-radar program that is no less competitive, offers 10 peer-selected students an inside look into the venture industry. Taking place over the course of one summer, the program is not highly structured but is designed to give students personal exposure to Greylock partners and founders who openly share their experiences and perspectives.

As well, Greylock is part of an exclusive group of VCs sponsoring [Interact](http://joininteract.com/) (a four-day gathering at Lake Tahoe with 100 young entrepreneurs) and the [Kairos Society](http://kairossociety.com/) (a community that connects entrepreneurs under the age of 25 with select corporate partners and VCs). And most recently, Greylock partner and cofounder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman launched a [new class](http://www.fastcompany.com/3051054/fast-feed/why-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-is-teaching-a-new-class-at-stanford) at Stanford on how and why startups in Silicon Valley have been able to scale so rapidly.

It's no question that many VCs these days strive to offer value-added services to their portfolio companies. But Greylock is taking it a step further by offering differentiated services to students--an important subset of the Millennial generation who could one day become part of Greylock's extended family.

Pejman Mar Ventures, a two-year-old seed stage firm, represents another example of the programmatic targeting of millennials by the venture community.

Founders [Pejman Nozad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pejman) and [Mar Hershenson](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mar-hershenson/0/395/b21) have built a unique, extensive community with strong ties to Stanford University. And if there was an award for time spent with student entrepreneurs at Stanford, they would certainly vie for the prize.

Pejman Mar's [Garage](http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/start-up-garage-palo-alto/) is a nine-month entrepreneurial and educational program involving 12 of the smartest computer science students at Stanford, hand-selected by their peers to start bridging the gap between academia and industry. For Nozad and Hershenson, the mission is first and foremost to develop enduring relationships with talented students, rather than create investment opportunities. The founders support students with entrepreneurial ambitions by giving them hacker space, mentorship, and access to their personal networks, all under the premise that 'paying it forward' and offering support now will potentially allow something extraordinary to grow in the future (and potentially lead to investment opportunities). This approach, they say, is particularly appreciated by Millennials given their long-term visions and appreciation for education--in this case, learning the ins and outs of entrepreneurism.

Pejman Mar's [Founders Program](http://founders.pejmanmar.com/), another innovative strategy targeting Millennial entrepreneurs, grew out of its Garage program to function more as a small-scale incubator. The summer Founders Program provides select Stanford-affiliated startups with a $25,000 stipend, space to live and work, 12 weeks of mentorship, and access to invaluable resources, including renowned VCs such as John Doerr and a popular life coach. Each batch of seven or eight companies presents at [an intimate but impressive gathering of VCs](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/03/seven-new-startups-from-silicon-valleys-favorite-new-demo-day/), with the hope to receive funding.

Most recently, Pejman Mar extended its activities beyond Stanford to create the [UC Berkeley Challenge](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/05/a-new-250000-startup-competition-for-berkeley-students-takes-shape/), a program the firm may replicate at other universities over time. The winning company amongst a collection of student-founded startups will receive $250,000 in seed financing in exchange for equity ownership, a portion of which Pejman Mar will donate back to the university.

While Pejman Mar, a small VC firm with a first-time fund, has just a fraction of the resources available to Greylock and other larger, more established VCs, it is certainly packing an enviable punch in its reach and impact on Millennial entrepreneurs.

**Our Final Thoughts**

It's no question that capturing the hearts, minds, and wallets of Millennials is not just a business preference but also a [necessity](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/business/media/marketers-fixation-on-the-millennial-generation.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) for many startups and corporate incumbents. Similarly, VCs feel the need to attract young entrepreneurs - and fast - or risk losing them and their ideas to competing investors. As a result, we've seen many VCs do things at the margins to connect with younger entrepreneurs. But with their creativity, time, and generous use of resources, Greylock and Pejman Mar are distinguishing themselves as particularly helpful to and engaged with budding entrepreneurs--at least until the emerging Generation Z throws a wrench into the mix.
