A Fibonacci poem, in which the # of syllables in each line = the sum of the # of syllables in the 2 preceding lines.

Who

would

have thought

that one man

would be inspired to

come up with a numerical

sequence that depicts so many things found in nature

such as leaf arrangement in plants, pattern of florets of a flower, bracts of pinecones,

spirals of seashells and whorls of galaxies and hurricanes? This Golden Ratio, symbol for which is 'phi,' one point six one eight, is a

fundamental characteristic of the universe. Can one, by searching, find the divine? The question vexed Job, but Fibonacci, if he did not, may have come close, for has it not been said that nature is God's second book?
