For some of us the words 'smart fabrics, 'smart textiles' and 'e-textiles' are still shiny and new, although pioneers have been innovating within the textile industry for a while now. The merger of fashion with technology is held up by the makers and designers who are coming up with different materials that offer convenience to the wearer. Knowing this should we be surprised that fashion tech like conductive threads was used as early as the Elizabethan era?

Knowledge is power, so make sure you take a moment to read something that our friends at[ LOOMIA](http://fashnerd.com/2017/09/loom-blockchain-technology/) created. It is a smart textile timeline from 1600- 2016. It shows how technology has played a crucial role in textiles. Read and learn.

  * **1600** -- Early conductive threads are said to date back to the Elizabethan era when gold threads were woven into garments for a gleaming accent. Now, we often use silver or nickel threads for conductivity, but the concept of metallic threads has existed for centuries for decorating garments.
  * **2007** -- Leah Buechley develops the [Lilypad](http://lilypadarduino.org/), a microcontroller made specifically for textiles. (Adafruit later makes its version called the [Flora](https://www.adafruit.com/products/659))
  * **2009-2012** --In 2009 project fibre artist [Lynne Bruning](http://www.lbruning.com/) started producing runway shows around e-textiles. This was followed by the [E-Textile Lounge](http://etextilelounge.com/) which Lynne and Angela Sheehan helped produce for Maker Faire 2011 and 2012. 2011 was the first time they used the term 'E-Textile Lounge' for a specific Maker Faire event.
