# Mobile usability 7: flexibility and ease of use

This is the seventh article in my [iPhone app usability series](http://mattish.com/blog/tag/mobile+usability), looking at apps that do a good job of applying the [Nielsen Norman Group's 10 interface usability heuristics](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). This time it's about how you can incorporate features that advanced users will benefit from so the app satisfies them as much as beginners. Here's the original guideline:

> Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

An oft-cited example of this principle in action is Amazon's '1 click buy' button, which gives a benefit to regular users but is in addition to the normal 'Add to basket' button so doesn't change anything for other users. It is something that is harder to get right on mobile apps as they are usually designed to simplify a process. Here are some examples of apps that I think manage to keep the simplicity and help advanced users, to give you some ideas for how it can be done.

### Trainline

The [Trainline](http://www.thetrainline.com/) app is designed primarily around booking UK train tickets as that's how the app makes its money, but I (and most others I know) use it mainly for checking train times. I've chosen it because it features several common functions for advanced usage in one app.

  1. The main action is to plan a journey or look at live train times, which is done by searching. 
  2. Any searches you do are automatically stored in the 'Me' section of the app as your recent journeys. At a glance you can see the next three times for each journey in a white box or 'card'. 
  3. The power-user functionality comes in with things like the very handy feature of switching the arrival/departure stations over--something I use a lot to save storing two separate journeys for the same route. 
  4. You can pin a trip card so it stays on this screen if it's one you frequently use. This is something heavy users will appreciate and a feature very similar to favourites and wish lists. 
  5. You can also delete a card from this screen by swiping left on the card. This is a piece of hidden functionality that you wouldn't be able to find without trying, but it is a common pattern on mobile and iOS so it won't be alien to regular users. 

### Google Drive

The [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) app is the mobile version of the very popular Google suite of document editing tools. I discovered this drag and drop functionality due to some handy helper text appearing when I logged in, showing that it pays to read this every now and then. It's a nicely executed gesture-based feature, unlike some which can be fiddly to recreate.

  1. This is another example of functionality hidden behind a touch gesture. However it is discoverable if you want to move an item, being activated by tapping and holding as if to drag it. 
  2. To affirm that this is happening the app then goes into a mode where the item is separated and shown as a floating element at the bottom of the screen. In this mode the file icons become check boxes that enable the user to select multiple files to join the selection. 
  3. Once the user is ready they can then drag the new floating files and release them over the folder they want them to join. 

### Apple's Calculator & Stocks

I generally try not to use Apple's built-in apps in these articles in preference to looking further afield but I love this use of displaying extra functionality and I'm not aware of others that do it so well. The calculator and stocks apps show different information and functionality when the phone is physically rotated. A nice way of the user displaying a change of intent.

  1. The calculator app is a standard calculator in its normal portrait orientation. When the phone is turned to landscape it becomes a scientific calculator, making better use of the available space to include extra buttons. 
  2. When in portrait orientation, the stocks and shares app lists out your stocks with a small graph underneath. By turning the phone horizontally you then get to study the graph of the share price performance. As it is displaying change over time, this content makes sense to be landscape and make the most of the left-to-right timeline to show the history of the stock. 

### Summary

Whether it is via extra icons in the interface, gestures or by physically altering the device, there are a variety of ways you can subtly get extra functions into a mobile app. Done well it can add delight to a user's experience. One thing I would advise though is not to add too many of these features, only do one or two per app for functionality that requires it. If you start to hide too many things there's a danger that the user doubts their ability to use the app or they lose trust in it as they constantly think they are missing things.
