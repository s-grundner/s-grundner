[GitHub](https://github.com/) today [shared](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) a closer look at how the popularity of programming languages used on its code collaboration website has changed over the years. In short, the graph above shows the change in rank for programming languages since GitHub launched in 2008 all the way to what the site's 10 million users are using for coding today.

GitHub is a repository hosting service that builds on the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git, which is strictly a command-line tool. GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface, as well as desktop and mobile integration.

To be clear, this graph doesn't show the definitive top 10 programming languages. Because GitHub has become so popular (even causing [Google Code to shut down](http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/12/google-code-disables-new-project-creation-will-shut-down-on-january-25-2016/)), however, it still paints a fairly accurate picture of programming trends over recent years.

Trend lines aside, here are the top 10 programming languages on GitHub today:

  1. JavaScript
  2. Java
  3. Ruby
  4. PHP
  5. Python
  6. CSS
  7. C++
  8. C#
  9. C
  10. HTML

The big climber is of course Java: The programming language grew more than any other language between 2008 and 2015. GitHub attributes the big rank change, from seventh to second, due to growing Android popularity, which in turn results in demands for business and enterprise version control.

Other noticeable trends can be explained by specifics to GitHub. The trend line for Ruby on Rails, for example, is likely due to the fact the programming language has been on GitHub since 2008.

The rank is represented by languages used in public and private repositories, excluding forks. It is calculated by a GitHub project called [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).

GitHub last week [launched GitHub Desktop](http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/12/github-desktop-launches-to-replace-mac-and-windows-apps-with-a-unified-experience/), a new app that replaces its previous Mac and Windows apps with a "unified experience." The company has yet to share how many of its 10 million users have downloaded the desktop app and how many choose to use the website exclusively.
