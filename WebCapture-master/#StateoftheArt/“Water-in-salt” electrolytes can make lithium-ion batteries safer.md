Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable, have a high energy storage capacity, and exhibit minimal loss of charge when not in use. In our day-to-day lives, we enjoy the benefits of this technology. We have e-readers that can last on battery power for weeks at a time and cell phones that do not need to be charged daily.

Yet lithium-ion battery adoption has remained constrained due to concerns over safety, cost, and environmental impact. Recently, an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers tackled one of these issues by developing a significantly safer lithium-ion battery.

Past safety concerns have focused on the electrolytes used in these batteries, which help transfer charge between the electrodes. These electrolytes are often highly flammable, reactive with other battery components (like the electrodes), and depend on highly toxic materials (lithium salts) to shuttle the charges. These safety concerns impose costly processing steps during fabrication of the batteries and limit their range of applications.

## An electrochemical stability window

In a study recently published in _Science_, scientists demonstrated a safe, aqueous electrolyte. In the past, use of aqueous electrolytes has been limited because they exhibit a narrow electrochemical stability window--the voltage range between which the battery's materials neither lose electrons (oxidation) nor gain them (reduction). As a consequence of this narrow electrochemical stability window, deterioration of the electrode structure often occurs due to hydrogen evolution at the anode.

When nonaqueous electrolyte systems are used, the electrodes (both cathode and anode) are usually functional over a much larger range. This results from the formation of a layer of solid electrolyte on the surface of the electrode, which constitutes a barrier that allows movement of ions and prevents movement of electrons. The interphase is formed when some of the electrolyte decomposes during initial charging.

This interface doesn't form in aqueous systems, because decomposition of water results in the formation of H2, O2, or OH-, none of which are deposited at the electrode surface. The lack of a solid electrolyte interface limits aqueous lithium ion (Li+) batteries to low voltage (<1.5 V) and low energy density (70 Wh/kg).

But the new work describes a way to manipulate electrolyte decomposition in aqueous electrolytes to form a solid-electrolyte interface.

## Establishing a solid electrolyte interface

In order to achieve this, the scientists needed to find a lithium salt that was highly soluble and chemically stable in water. On top of that, they needed a salt that was capable of accepting electrons at a specific potential, causing a reaction that produced a solid product that was insoluble in aqueous media. Few lithium salts meet these requirements, but the researchers found one--lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)--worth exploring.

Using LiTFSI, the researchers created a highly concentrated solution (molality > 20), meaning the Li+ ions actually outnumber the water molecules. The remarkably high number of ions in this "water-in-salt" solution results in unusual behaviors. In fact, interactions between the Li+ ions become more common than the typical water-ion interactions found in salt solutions.

Due to these ion-ion interactions, the Li+ ions are able to form a dense interphase surrounding the electrode (anode) where they gain electrons. Because of this interface, the electrochemical stability window is increased to ~3.0 V.

Thermal analysis of the 20-mole and 21-mole solutions from room temperature down to -90° C revealed that the solutions were still "true" liquids--exhibiting no order. At room temperature, the conductivity of a 21 mole solution is comparable to nonaqueous electrolytes used in commercial Li-ion batteries. The researchers also found that as the LiTFSI concentration increased, the total electrochemical stability window expanded.

Overall, they found that high concentrations of LiTFSI in water reduces water activity, modulates redox potentials, and suppresses the decomposition of water through formation of a solid-electrolyte interface.

## Understanding the solid-electrolyte interface

Using a variety of analytical techniques, the team demonstrated the existence of an interphase in the aqueous electrolytes. This analysis also allowed the team to develop an understanding of the Li+ sheath and its role in the interphasial chemistry.

In a normal, dilute solution (<5 mole), water is abundant and is able to form a normal sheath around both Li+ and TFSI-, which are surrounded by four water molecules. If you increase the salt concentration, we eventually get to a point (>10 mole solution) where there is not enough water to create this sheath.

In a 21-mole solution, you push the salt concentration far past this point, and the solution exists in a state where there are only 2.6 water molecules per each Li+. In this state, the water is not able to effectively neutralize the electrostatic field created by the positive charge on the lithium ion. The excess positive charge then attracts the negatively charged TFSI- ion. TFSI- then enters the sheath, leading to a Li+TFSI- interaction. This forms on the anode, where TFSI- is reduced, releasing fluorine that forms LiF.

Formation of solid-electrolyte interface at the anode allows the voltage to be decoupled from the cycling stability. Additionally, the shortage of free water molecules decreases electrochemical activity, which benefits the stability limits of both electrodes.

The authors constructed a full Li-ion cell with electrodes composed of LiMn2O4 (cathode) and Mo6S8 (anode). These full cells exhibited excellent stability, high capacity retention, and almost 100 percent coulombic efficiency.
