# Why Do We Still Use The Golden Ratio In Design?

Graphic design is a cutting edge industry. It's all about innovation -- appealing to audiences in new ways through new types of media and using new technology to do it. The software programs, the types of paper we use â€¦ most of it has just become available within the past few decades. Yet in the midst of our clamoring for the new-and-improved, one design concept stands out as an exception.

The golden ratio is perhaps one of the oldest design concepts still in use today -- it was discovered over 1,500 years ago. That means people have been using the golden ratio in spite of collapsing empires, cultural shifts, and hundreds of wars. The question is, why?

### History Of The Golden Ratio

You may recall hearing about a man named Fibonacci. He discovered a series of numbers called the Fibonacci sequence. Basically, you add each new number to the one that came before it, starting with 0 and 1. So it looks like this:

Now, remember those collapsing empires we mentioned earlier? One of those was ancient Greece -- which was the world's leading intellectual hub in its heyday. During that time, the Greeks noticed something weird about the numbers in Fibonacci's sequence. The larger the numbers in the sequence get, the difference between two adjacent numbers gets closer to 1:1.618. They called their discovery the golden ratio.

### The Golden Ratio In Nature

Once the Greeks discovered the golden ratio, they realized something else: it's _everywhere_. In plants, animals, art --it's even in buildings that were constructed before the Greeks came to power. Here's just a small taste of where you can see the golden ratio today:

### Including The Golden Ratio In Design

You may have noticed that most of the photos have a spiral running through them. The golden spiral is comprised of a series of interlocking rectangles that adhere to the 1:1.618 ratio. When you overlay the golden spiral on a design, you can see whether or not it fits the golden ratio.

So, what exactly can the golden ratio and its accompanying spiral do for your designs?

The short answer is, pretty much everything. You can use the golden ratio to make sure that headlines are proportionately sized relative to body text. You can use it to help you determine the overall layout of the design by placing text and pictures into the different rectangles that make up the golden spiral.

You can even use the golden ratio for sizing and cropping photos. When this photo is cropped and a golden spiral placed over it, you can see that the dog's face is the focal point of the photo.

With its limitless possibilities in nature and the numerous ways it can be used in design, it's no wonder the golden ratio has been around for so long.
