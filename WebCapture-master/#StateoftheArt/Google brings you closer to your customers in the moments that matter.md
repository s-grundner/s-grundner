Mobile has changed the game for both consumers and brands. Consumer expectations for immediacy and relevance are higher than ever, and successful brands are those that connect with people in the moments that matter most to them -- the I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do, and I-want-to-buy moments. Google is a company built on meeting people's needs in the moment. Through our ads innovations, we've brought that ability to businesses large and small.

On Monday afternoon at Advertising Week's [Times Center Stage](http://advertisingweek.com/live/), I'll be announcing two new products, Customer Match and Universal App Campaigns, to help you be there and be relevant in those intent-rich moments that truly matter.

**Reach your most valuable customers with Customer Match**

70% of online consumers agree that the quality, timing, and relevance of a brand's message influences their perception of a brand.1 Google is in a unique position to connect consumers with your business in the most relevant ways. Whether they're searching on Google, checking promotions on Gmail, or watching videos on YouTube, we can deliver the most relevant information based on what they're doing, wherever they are, when they're looking, and on any device they're using. Today, we're building on these capabilities with new ads innovations to deliver even more relevance.

When it comes to your most valuable customers, they expect even more from you. And now, Google can help you reach customers that you already have a relationship with -- like those in your loyalty program or who have made a previous purchase -- in ways that are **most relevant** to their **intent** and **context**.

**Customer Match** is a new product designed to help you reach your highest-value customers on Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail -- when it matters most. Customer Match allows you to upload a list of email addresses, which can be matched to signed-in users on Google in a secure and privacy-safe way. From there, you can build campaigns and ads specifically designed to reach your audience. Users can control the ads they see, including Customer Match ads, by opting out of personalized ads or by muting or blocking ads from individual advertisers through [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated).

> Let's say you're a travel brand. You can now reach people who have joined your rewards program as they plan their next trip. For example, when these rewards members search for "non-stop flights to new york" on Google.com, you can show relevant ads at the top of their search results on any device right when they're looking to fly to New York. And when those members are watching their favorite videos on YouTube or catching up on Gmail, you can show ads that inspire them to plan their next trip.

Using Customer Match, you can also generate Similar Audiences to reach new customers on YouTube and Gmail who are likely to be interested in your products and services. For example, you can drive awareness on YouTube for new non-stop flights by showing TrueView ads to prospective customers who have similar interests and characteristics to your rewards members.

With Customer Match, your brand is right there, with the right message, at the moment your customer is most receptive. Only Google can help you do this to delight your most loyal customers in the moments that truly matter.

Customer Match and Similar Audiences will be rolling out to all advertisers over the next few weeks. [Learn More](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6276125).

**Promote your apps with unparalleled reach**

People discover new apps in many ways: online searches, recommendations while watching their favorite videos, and in-app suggestions. If your business has an app, you need a scalable way to reach the customers that are most likely to install your app -- across a variety of channels.

Starting today, [Universal App Campaigns](http://adwords.blogspot.com/2015/05/new-media-partnerships-and-ad-solutions.html) will be available to all developers and advertisers as a new AdWords campaign type that helps you connect with app users across Google Search, Google Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network (GDN). In just a few simple steps, you can promote your app with unparalleled reach across the world's largest network and platforms.

> Let's say you've built an adventure game. With Universal App Campaigns, you have unparalleled reach: you can drive installs on YouTube, the platform with 1B+ users who watch hundreds of millions of hours of content everyday. Your ads can also reach specific audiences across 650K apps and 2M+ websites in the GDN. And importantly, Universal App Campaigns tap into intent-rich searches like "adventure games" and "puzzle games" that are happening throughout the day on Google Search and Google Play so your app can be seen when people are looking to download something new.

All you need to do is give us your desired cost-per-install and we do the rest. Universal App Campaigns are the one-stop-shop campaign type that scales your reach and maximizes Android app installs across Google's entire suite of ad platforms. We've automated campaign set-up by pulling in your app images, videos, and app description directly from your Google Play store listing to generate ad formats that look amazing wherever they're placed.

From there, our systems will optimize your campaigns using dynamic learning to maximize app install volume at your target cost-per-install. By testing different versions of your ad text and app images in each of the eligible Google networks, we determine the highest-performing variations so only your best ads show.

The energy and buzz at Advertising Week 2015 ([Join the conversation](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=GoogleAW2015&via=AdWords&)) reinforces what an exciting time it is to be a marketer. I'm privileged to get to build products that help brands tell their stories and connect with consumers in the moments that really matter to them.
