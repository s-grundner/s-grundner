# What city planning can teach us about building stuff that solves real problems.

Salt Lake City is growing. In fact, conservative projections are telling us that SLC will more than [double it's population by 2050](http://envisionutah.org/) (we have about 3 million folks right now in Utah, and that's supposed to skyrocket over the next few decades).

We've been lucky here. The whole valley is sandwiched between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Salt Lake. That means that planning for growth has been relatively easy for a number of reasons. For instance, we've built a [high speed rail system](http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=FrontRuner-AboutFrontRunner) that is used heavily by our residents and alleviates massive amounts of traffic congestion. The rail system is effective, in large part, due to the geographic sandwiching of our urban areas- everything is constrained by the mountains and the lake, so all traffic runs north and south. All we had to do was build a bunch of trains that run up and down the valley and, _voila_, traffic problems dropped significantly.

The urban center of Salt Lake has also been on the move to anticipate growth intelligently. Mayor Ralph Becker, who has served two terms as SLC's mayor, has worked hard to form a preemptive strike against the potential negative effects of growth. New [libraries](http://www.slcpl.org/branches/view/Main+Library), [museums](https://nhmu.utah.edu/), and civic centers have been built, and Salt Lake City boasts the [most successful public biking system in the nation](http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/featured-articles/7594-greenbike-sets-national-ridership-record). In fact, thanks to the cities careful planning, I personally have a 10 minute commute via protected bike lanes from my house to [Underbelly](http://underbelly.is) where I work as a PM. Arguably, there have been more innovative city-planning decisions in Salt Lake over the last decade than the last 3 decades combined.

Salt Lake City also recently introduced a "smart" parking system to allow those people who drive into the city to pay for parking with credit cards or via the [Park SLC app](http://www.parkingslc.com/). Each station is powered via solar energy, and the system boasts a robust mobile app that allows users to pay for and monitor their parking. Something very important to SLC residents trying to find a place to leave their vehicle for a few hours, as the city has banned any new, additional above ground parking developments in the city center (a decision I personally support as the city invest more resources into building businesses and structures that support the health of the city itself).

Here's the problem though- the Park SLC app is _terrible. _It's bloated, unattractive, and (worst of all) it takes a real problem and provides a solution that actually complicates the problem that needed to be solved in the first place. By looking at the apps mistakes, we can learn a bit about how, as builders of products, we can build things that people will actually love to use. Let's use the Park SLC app as an example.

### **Bad product thinking knows what the problem is, but doesn't actually solve the problem.**

Duh. This seems painfully obvious, but let's dig in. Let's first identify what problem Salt Lake's parking app is trying to solve. Really it's pretty simple- parking downtown sucks. Finding a spot is time-consuming, paying for parking takes up time that you'd rather be spent doing other things (like getting omakase nigiri from [Takashi](http://www.10best.com/destinations/utah/salt-lake-city/downtown/restaurants/takashi-1/) or running into Ty Burrel at [the Beer Bar](http://www.beerbarslc.com/)), and it's really distracting to try to enjoy your Friday night if you're constantly worried about when your time is going to hit zero on the meter.

The app does some of this, but it doesn't do any of it in a way that actually solves the problem. Sure, the app allows you to pay for parking, keep track of your payments, and keep an eye on when your time is about to expire. However, simply offering a way for a user to complete the task they are trying to accomplish does _not_ necessarily solve a problem.

### **Good product thinking solves problems by simplifying real world tasks, and gives the user the ability to complete the task in the _way_ they _WANT_ to.**

In order to understand how an app can offer a solution, but not actually solve the problem it's trying to solve, we have to look at the process of using the Park SLC app for a new user. Should be pretty simple right? I pick a spot, pay for it, and I'm done. Not so fast my friend. Buckle up, because it appears the app has chosen the scenic route.

What you're staring at here is the first time experience for someone who wants to pay for parking. There are 18 (count em, _eighteen_) steps to pay for parking for a new user. For the love. I can pay my taxes in less steps. Even after the first time app setup, there are still 7-8 steps to pay for parking, depending on if you need to sign in again later.

Imagine that you are visiting SLC for the first time. You look up great places to get a doner sandwich and a beer, so you naturally end up at [Spitz](http://spitzslc.com/.) downtown. You're a little worried because there's a Jazz game going on and it's a Saturday night.

Will you find a spot close to Spitz? Will you have to drive around looking for hours? Will the Jazz win? You pull up to the restaurant and (gasp!) there is a spot for you right up front! Brother Brigham smiled upon you today. So you pull up, parallel park like a stunt driver from Tokyo Drift, and tell your friends to go on ahead while you pay for parking.

Then the fun begins.

First, you need to download the app. A QR code on the parking stall! What luck! So you open your camera, snap a photo, and wait for the pixels to hit the nearest satellite. A full minute later and you've finally found the app. It's downloading. 12 delicious megabytes later and you're good to go. Well, not really, but you feel better knowing that you have the app in tow and don't have to deal with this whole process again. Surely the spot will be paid for and you'll be eating a delicious, mediterranean, street car style wrap in no time. Right?

Wrong. First, for some reason you need to create an account. You know what that means- _usernames and passwords_. Authentication. Validating your email. Giving away your personal information. Accepting terms and conditions. The list of tasks ahead of you starts pilling up. But you need to park, so you take a deep breath and consign yourself to the mind-numbing tasks ahead of you. Eight steps later and you think you're almost there, so you walk in to Spitz to join your friends. Just when you think you're home free to hang out with your buddies in line while you enter the rest of your credit card information, the app asks for your "zone."

"Zone! What the hell is a zone!? I didn't see a zone anywhere." Already things are getting out of hand. So you excuse yourself and rush back to your car to figure this thing out before you end up with a parking ticket that costs more than your actual meal. You finally discover what your zone is and decide to just finish setting up the app by your car just in case there is some other piece of information you didn't know you needed. License plate number, gas mileage, color of upholstery, who the hell knows what's next.

Step by step, you get closer to the finish line -- space number, exact duration of stay, manual entry of credit car information, confirmation page after confirmation page, modal after success modal. And then, finally, you get the last screen telling you that you have successfully paid for your parking. Exasperated, but proud of your ability to use modern technology, you strut towards the door_ just in time_ to catch your friends meet you on their way out, having already finished two beers and their entire doner baskets.

This is what bad products do. They provide a solution that, theoretically, accomplishes the task the user is trying to solve. But they don't _actually _solve the problem.

### **Using bad products actually makes for a worse experience than if you had never used the app in the first place.**

What _should _happen is that technology should solve the problem in a way that reduces steps, reduces mental strain, saves time, and helps the user feel valued. The issue with the parking app is _not_ that it doesn't allow you to pay for parking or to check on how much time you have left, because you can technically do those things in the app. The problem is that _not_ using the app in the first place is _a lot_ easier than actually using the app. Paying for your spot by walking a half block to one of the free-standing kiosks takes a fraction of the time that the app demands. People want to get past the stress of parking so that they focus on dinner, family, friends, and getting responsibly blitzed -- That's the real problem we're trying to solve here. The app simply doesn't allow the user to do what they really want to do, which goes beyond simply affording some way to pay for a parking spot.

At Underbelly, we take a half day on Friday's to work on non-client projects that we are passionate about. Sometime's it's a chance to flex your creative muscles, to solve problems we are passionate about, or to write a sweet Medium article (hence what you're reading now). Last week for Hack Friday, Adam and Scrib (two of our designers) took it upon themselves to solve Salt Lake City's parking app problem.

Here are the fruits of their labor-

The user experience here is distilled down to it's most basic ingredients. There are a total of three steps required to pay.

So how do you take 18 steps and simplify them into 3? We focused on a few areas --

  1. We leveraged existing technology. We don't need to ask for someone's "zone." For Pete's sake, we already know what zone they are in because we can access a their location through the phone's GPS. We also don't need to ask them to input their credit card manually. All phones have camera's with the ability to read text (we even found an API option specifically for reading credit cards that is open source and free to use), so this allows people to scan their card in seconds and avoid tedious manual data entry.
  2. We didn't present complex options when they weren't needed. We didn't need complicated, granular inputs asking for how long they want to stay. Most people don't know _exactly_ how long they need a spot, they know _generally_ how long they will be there. So we present simple, frequently used options that take little interaction or extra thought from the user.
  3. We didn't create extra UI or pages when they aren't needed. Keeping the information someone needs to care about persistent as they continue through the flow allows us to have _one_ confirmation page at the end of the process, instead of many extra pages at each step like the old app has. A user can see the location they chose, the time they selected, and their payment details at each step and only needs to say "yes" once.
  4. We helped the user feel valued and see the apps value right up front. People can see exactly where they are in the process because they can see how close they are to completing their parking from the app's status bar. Three steps. That's it. I don't feel overwhelmed, I can see the value of the app, and the app delivers on that promise by getting me the hell away from this parking spot and onto the rest of the night.

Hacking the design on the Park SLC app was a great exercise. It's great as a designer, or a dev, or a PM, to not only stretch outside our regular realms of influence to learn about what can be improved about the world around us, but to then bring those findings home. After all, a critical look the mistakes others make does nothing for us if we don't take a humble look at ourselves. In closing, we've learned a few things about good product thinking over the years, and good products usually do these things-

  1. They **utilize available resources** to remove extra tasks.
  2. They **reduce steps**, where possible.
  3. They **decrease the mental strain** it would take someone to solve the problem without the product.
  4. They, generally, **take less time **than alternative methods of solving the problem.
  5. They help the user feel **delighted and valued**.

Now, go make cool stuff that solves real problems. Because, really, there are bigger fish to fry than parking.
