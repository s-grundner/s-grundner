##### Once again, Technical University of Munich (TUM) secured an extremely good rank in the renowned QS World University Ranking. TUM took first place among the German universities, with a worldwide ranking of 60th. In the rankings by discipline, TUM also topped the list for natural sciences and engineering in Germany. And TUM scored among the top five technical universities in Europe.

The [QS World University Ranking](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2015#) uses indicators like reputation among academics and employers, how often an institute's publications are cited, the student-teacher ratio and proportion of international staff and students. This year, citations were weighted by discipline for the first time in order to balance the high number of citations in subjects such as medicine and the life sciences against lower figures in other subject areas. Rankings in the individual disciplines only took into account the school's reputation in research and teaching and its citation frequency.

TUM is the fifth best European technical university. Globally, TUM placed 19 in the natural sciences and 30 in engineering - an impressive performance.

The ranking was dominated by US and British universities, with a number of Asian schools also performing well. In addition to TUM at the top of the German list, three other universities in Germany ranked in the top 100 in the world: Heidelberg University (66th place), LMU in Munich (75th) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (93rd).

In the [Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai ranking)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2015.html), published in August, TUM also performed well - 51st place put the university in the German top three.
