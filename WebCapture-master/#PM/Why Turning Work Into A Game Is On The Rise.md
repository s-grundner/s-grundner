> _Will gamification at work be a game-changer?_

Gamification -- the idea that you can take [gaming elements](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/10/07/adam-penenberg-how-gamification-is-going-to-change-the-workplace/) (points, trophies, badges, scoreboards, level-ups, etc) and apply them in non-gaming contexts -- is a rising trend that makes work all play.

By harvesting the very psychological traits that make [games](http://www.forbes.com/games/) so appealing-competition, cooperation, vanity, and the need for challenge -- gamification makes normally routine, or even unpleasant tasks more rewarding. But in a business world crowded with buzzwords, from "synergy" to "the cloud" to the "Internet of Things," is gamification really a game-changer?

That will depend on how companies apply it. By 2014, 70 percent of Forbes Global 2000 companies [are expected to have developed](http://m.accenture.com/us-en/outlook/Pages/outlook-journal-2013-why-gamification-is-serious-business.aspx) at least one game-type application for their business. In healthcare, games rewarding patients for [having checkups, eating properly, and encouraging exercise](http://www.businessinsider.com/gamification-in-healthcare-2013-1) are already widespread. In business, companies like FourSquare and Untappd use badges and points to reward customers for patronizing different businesses.

But gamification isn't only applied on the consumer side. Take a company like Red Critter, whose Tracker platform for Agile software development [gives participants badges and rewards for completing tasks](http://www.redcrittertracker.com/). The rewards can be redeemed in a host company's Rewards Store while the badges are public to everyone involved in the project.

Companies looking to incorporate gamification in their office should be aware that while research shows it can make tasks more rewarding to complete and consequently enhance performance, it only works [in the right context and to the right kind of users](http://gamification-research.org/2013/09/does-gamification-work-a-look-into-research/). Games and rewards have to match the motivational and social context of the players. Gamification seems to work better, generally, in non-utilitarian contexts. Poorly-implemented gamification, like having rationally-focused games in an intuition-driven environment is bound to fail. On top of this, many of the current benefits of gamification might be attributable to the simple fact that gamification is still a novelty, and users might tire of playing games if they become commonplace.

In order for gamification to retain its transformative power long-term it needs to evolve beyond badges, trophies, points and rewards. The next step is to take business problems and [map them to actual game play.](http://www.gamification.co/2013/04/03/moving-beyond-points-and-badges-gamification-2-0/) This means that by playing a specifically designed game, you would actually be solving a serious problem. "Gamification 2.0â€³ is not just about obtaining carrots, it's about solving puzzles. That involves a greater level of challenge, both for the "game designers" as well as the players, but the potential rewards are outstanding.

The good news is that this trend is already happening. Foldit is a [gaming platform where players are tasked to solve puzzles](http://fold.it/portal/), and their solutions offer direct benefits to science. Recently, gamers helped to solve a [long-standing problem in HIV research](http://news.techeye.net/science/gamers-solve-hiv-problem) via Foldit. Scientists struggling to determine the shape of a key AIDS-mimicking enzyme turned to Foldit gamers, who were used to playing spatial reasoning games involving folding. Within ten days, the gamers had solved the problem.

Extending this type of ingenuity to the business world isn't a stretch, but it'll require imagination, investment, and innovation -- concepts that carry real weight, require effort, and are certainly more than just buzzwords.
