Having to handle too much information is a problem for any project manager. An efficient way to keep up with what employees are working on is crucial for on-time project delivery: an unclear process impairs discipline and productivity, jeopardizing deadlines and agreed upon delivery dates.

Many project management tools are available on the market, so we made a review of the best ones that offer a simple and uncluttered management process. We intentionally did not include such widely used tools as Trello, Basecamp, etc. in this review, because we have to admit: we doubt that there's something new to share about them. So here's our list.

## 1\. actiTIME

Initially designed as a time-tracking tool, [actiTIME](https://www.actitime.com/) is now turning into a robust work management tool that provides various helpful features. With it, you can assign projects to team members, set up time estimates for tasks, and monitor project budgets.

Rich reporting functionality allows project managers to review all necessary details on work performed within a project. Both time and billing data are available, so the tool is helpful in managing work progress, planning project costs, and issuing invoices for customers. You can see the reports in the program's interface, export them into CSV, or create colorful charts based on the report data.

Unlike many others, this solution is available both as an online service and an on premise application. And if you often have to work when you're not at your desk, use the native mobile app for iOS and Android that connects to the application's server and synchronizes all the data between the server and your mobile device.

## 2\. Taiga

The creators of this simple, functional, and beautiful tool admit that before they created [Taiga](https://taiga.io/), they had tried many other project management solutions but found them clumsy, unintuitive, and ugly to look at. That's why they went ahead and created a tool that they dreamt of. The result is this powerful, intuitive, and elegant solution. And - it's open-source, so you can download and use it for free.

If you keep projects in other tools, that's no problem. Multiplatform importers allow to bring all project data from major project management tools into Taiga and manage them there.

## 3\. Waffle

[Waffle](https://waffle.io/) is a tool for software development teams that automates project management on the basis of GitHub issues and pull requests. Automated status updates eliminate manual work when notifying your colleagues that your work is started, ready for review, or finished. The tool has a built-in metrics feature with milestone burndown and throughput graphs that help managers keep track of the progress of a project.

## 4\. Overv.io

[This tool](https://overv.io/) helps connect GitHub and your project management process. It provides lists of issues, a Kanban board, collaboration features, and custom statuses for your issues - to keep track of what's going on between the "open" and "closed" states.

If you need more than just tracking project progress, the tool offers time estimates for issues, document attachments, and special filters for early identification of possible problems that could ruin the project. If the desktop application is not enough, an Android app is also available on Google Play.

## 5\. Gantt Pro

[Gantt Pro](https://ganttpro.com/ru/) is an online solution for managing projects and tracking the progress on interactive Gantt charts. Add comments and attachments to the project tasks, export your charts in different formats, and get notified of the latest changes. Team management, costs estimates, and resource planning are also included in the functionality of this tool.

In Gantt Pro, you can connect tasks with each other and review their influence on the project in general. The Critical Path feature allows a project manager to see the shortest time to accomplish the project and highlight the most important tasks that require special attention.

## 6\. Liquid Planner

[This project management solution](https://www.liquidplanner.com/) is designed to create realistic project delivery plans - and automatically adapt to recent changes. Any project manager knows how difficult it is to adjust project completion dates when specific tasks' priorities shift or resources unexpectedly change. With Liquid Planner, you'll instantly receive an automatically updated project schedule, so you'll be able to focus on your immediate work instead of re-planning.

The tool allows you to create informative charts that visualize project progress, budgets, and other data. Other visibility features include dashboards that you can share with your customers and a Kanban-style card view that provides insight into the project workflow.

## 7\. FreedCamp

[FreedCamp](https://freedcamp.com/) is a hybrid of a to-do manager and a simple project planner: it combines tasks, milestones, and events. The tool provides a to-do list view, a Kanban board (that looks more like sticky notes), and a calendar view where all important things are shown. Or, if you'd like to unclutter your schedule, the tool can show only a selected type of events.

## 8\. MeisterTask

The creators of [MeisterTask](https://www.meistertask.com/ru) claim this is the most intuitive project and task management tool on the web, and it seems that they did their best to build a functional instrument without cluttered interfaces and hard-to-learn functionality.

The tool integrates with MindMeister, the mind-mapping app designed for brainstorming new ideas and creating project plans. Once the new project is created in MindMeister, you can transfer its tasks into MeisterTask and collaborate with others to complete them.

## 9\. 2-plan

[2-plan](http://2-plan.com/) is positioned as a free alternative to MS Project software. It is free and open-source, available for desktops and iOS mobile devices. The application allows you to plan projects ahead, create mind maps, build graphs, and define dependencies between specific tasks. This helps understand project scopes, distribute workload, and allocate resources wisely.

As an additional element, the Work 2-gether task management system is available. It visualizes the project structure on a Kanban board and helps create an efficient workflow to deliver your projects on time.

## 10\. BamBam!

[The tool](https://www.dobambam.com/) offers a convenient way to work on projects and manage them. It is flexible and configurable for any user role - client, manager, regular employee, or power user. Use simple to-do lists or create complex workflows, get all the important updates from the news feed, and use milestones to run long-term projects.

BamBam! provides many features that speed up project management processes. Smart updates, mentions, easy email-to-task conversion, estimates and much more save managers' time, simplify collaboration and keep everyone posted on the latest news and updates on the project.
