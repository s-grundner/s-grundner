# How Jira can simplify project management in IT

Project management is a crucial aspect when it comes to internet services and software solutions developing.

There is always a moment in any IT company when a task pool (in the product version) becomes so enormous that plain memorizing stops working. This is where project management systems step in.

Fortunately both managers and developers are lucky to have such an abundance of systems, that can help them organize working process.  
Here in JetRuby we use Jira, Trello, Pivotal, GitHub, Asana and others. But it is Jira that we would like to draw your attention to, due to it's agility and various capabilities concerning release management.

So here are some benefits you can get from it.

### Getting started with versions control

Versions are checkpoints of a project. They make it easier for you to plan and organize your releases. As soon as the version is created and filled, it becomes accessible in the drop-down tasklist. The link to Releases also appears in the navigational side panel.

To begin with you need to carry out these steps:

  * Log in to Jira as a project administrator.
  * Select 'Settings', then click "projects" and click the project name. The project summary should open.
  * Select "Versions" in the left side panel.

### How to add a new version:

1\. Click "add a new version" (fill-in form in the upper panel "Versions").  
2\. Type in the version name. It can be:

  * simple numeric, e.g. "2.1",
  * complex numeric, e.g. "2.1.3",
  * a word as an internal project code-name, e.g. "duck".

3\. Specify various version description details, start and release dates.  
4\. Click the "add" button. You can randomly drag-and-drop the versions.

### How can start date adding be of great help

The advantage you get when choosing the start date is that it is much easier for a manager or a team lead to evaluate the ongoing activity and make an appropriate decision.

### Multiple versions merging

To speed up a release or to merge version tasks you can use the "Merge" button. When the modal window is opened you can choose in what version to move the tasks.

### Versions management tips

Here is what you can do when managing versions:

  * post the release,
  * make an archive,
  * delete the version.

These operations are accessible in the right drop-down list in every version name line ("gear-wheel" makes it easier to find it).

### What are reports needed for

After you added all necessary versions, "Releases" button becomes accessible (it's icon looks like a ship) in the left navigational panel of the project. When clicked it shows the versions list with a progress line (green means "done", yellow -- "in progress", blue -- "to be done", red -- "issues noticed").

If you click any of the versions more detailed description with tasklists will show up.

Summing it up we would also like to mention that agile development support (Agile, Scrum and Kanban), which we regularly use, depending on the project and customer preferences, has been a nice extra to the new Jira version. These bonuses are unavailable in basic Jira package, but all you need is to install official "Jira Agile" addon.

### Nota Bene!

When a developer creates sub-tasks while not attaching them to a version, "cruise control" version panel gives no comprehensive picture regarding the situation.

So each newly created sub-task must be attached to a version (not necessarily to a master task version, because it can be done in later sprints) in order to see the broad picture concerning the implementation process displayed on the reports panel.
