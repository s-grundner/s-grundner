The workforce is full of a spectra of personalities, however thanks to the DiSC Assessment, four behavioral profiles stand out. Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance prompted the study's acronym to feature the profiles within its very own name, and while people will exhibit a mix of each of the four, most of us are particularly "high" in one or two areas.

Eastern Nazarene, which offers a masters degree in management within its division of adult and graduate studies department, took a closer look at how to spot the characteristics of each DiSC profile, in the hopes to close the gap on managing personalities in an office/business setting.

Dominance is a behavior that shapes the environment, overcoming opposition to achieve results. As expected, dominant personalities are motivated by winning, competition and success. Negative traits may include speaking loudly, interrupting, direct emails, poor at reading emotions, and he or she may be surprised if directness is perceived as unkind. Eastern Nazarene suggests leading "high Ds" by being direct and concise. Motivation should lie in giving them opportunities to work independently, setting their own goals and encouragement of big-picture ambitions. Improvement areas may include patience, sensitivity and allowing deliberation.

Influencers shape the environment by persuasion. They are motivated by social recognition, group activities and relationships. While they may tend to turn work events into social gatherings and are eager to talk, influencers may jump from subject to subject or take longer than most to get the point across. Communication with "high Is" should be through engaged listening while keeping them on task. Put details in writing, and deliver praise publicly. Help them improve by working on follow-through, speaking candidly and staying focused for long periods.

Those with Steadiness emphasize cooperation with others in the existing environment to reach goals. They are eager to help and emphasize sincere appreciation. While excellent listeners, they are not highly expressive, not easily excitable and are calm. They tend to avoid unfamiliar topics. "High Ss" are agreeable, supportive and reserved. Communicate with the S by allowing time for small talk, listening closely and responsively and avoiding being demanding or forceful. Avoid rushing results, provide collaboration opportunities, and work on assertiveness, multitasking and adapting to change.

Compliant personalities work conscientiously in the existing environment to ensure quality and accuracy. They are motivated by opportunities to gain knowledge, show expertise and do quality work. Those in Compliance prefer to avoid social talk, ask detail-oriented questions and may keep notes of the conversation. The perfectionist behavior in Compliance can be nurtured by preparing specifics, providing facts and avoiding forcing quick responses. Motivated Cs by providing opportunities for independent projects, allowing them to show their expertise and showing interest in their ideas. Cs may need help in delegation, joining in social events and making quick decisions.
