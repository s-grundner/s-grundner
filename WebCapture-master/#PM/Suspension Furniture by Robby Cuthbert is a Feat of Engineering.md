While many furniture designs can boast that they are put together with no screws, glue or nails, very few can say they rely on nothing but tension but that is exactly what the Suspension Furniture by [Robby Cuthbert](http://www.robbycuthbert.com/products/) does. By running Stainless Steel cables from the outermost points of the curves and from the innermost points, the tension from the shortest distances to the greatest distances become opposing forces that hold each other in place for maximum stability.

The multitude of cables and the fact that the legs within the Contour Table don't touch make this coffee table as much a feat of engineering as it is a sculptural design and that is no accident as Robby studied both sculpture and engineering at Williams College.
