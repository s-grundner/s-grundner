Palmer Performance Engineering, Inc. is the industry leader in vehicle diagnostic and communications software. Our products are used around the world by the vehicle manufacturers, independent repair shops, and home do-it-yourself'ers alike. Palmer Performance was one of the first companies to bring powerful diagnostics and data logging support to the general public and continues to lead the industry in diagnostic software performance, compatibility, coverage, and innovation.

Professional Diagnostics:  
Gone are the days when you have to spend thousands of dollars on expensive tools that only work with vehicles from a single automaker. Our professional [scan tool](http://www.palmerperformance.com/products/index.php) enables you to perform both simple and advanced diagnostic tasks without spending a fortune. Our products support enhanced diagnostics for many different vehicle types and generic diagnostics on all OBD-II compliant vehicles across the world.

Clear your Check Engine Light:  
Don't waste your time and money going to a mechanic just to find out why your check-engine light is on. A mechanic will typically charge you $75 for this simple diagnostic procedure. Using our [scan tools](http://www.palmerperformance.com/products/index.php), you could do it at home at your convenience, without the frustration of going to the mechanic only to find out your gas cap was loose.
  


  

Emissions:  
Is it time for your vehicle to get an emissions test? Most states now do their testing through the OBD-II port for '96 and newer vehicles. Our [scan tools](http://www.palmerperformance.com/products/index.php) will allow you to check your emissions status before you go wait in line to pay for the test, so you can be confident that it will pass!
