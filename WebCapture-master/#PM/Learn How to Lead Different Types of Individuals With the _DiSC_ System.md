A strong leader knows that different team members often require different communication tactics, and the "DiSC" behavior assessment system might help you speak everyone's language and get through to them.

The [DiSC behavior assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment) is based on the theories of psychologist William Moulton Marston, and it centers on four major behavioral traits that everyone has on some level in the workplace: dominance, influence, compliance, and steadiness. The graphic below from [Eastern Nazarene College's](https://www.enc.edu/adult-studies/) business management masters program explains how to determine what behavioral traits your team members have, how they prefer to work and communicate, and most importantly, how to provide feedback to each type of person. For example, if you're dealing with someone that has a lot of dominance (they're competitive, decisive, and independent), direct compliments are a great way to praise them and criticism needs to be very specific. Check it out below to learn more.
