# Employees Perform Better When They Can Control Their Space

If you want to build a [culture of high performance](https://hbr.org/special-collections/insight/high-performance-culture), start by taking a look at your office environment. It matters more than you may realize.

As co-CEO of the design and architectural firm [Gensler](http://www.gensler.com/), I've spent my career designing workplaces and studying the link between design and business performance. Our firm's four decades of collective experience and [research](http://www.gensler.com/#viewpoint) indicate that an optimal physical environment can serve as a foundation for an effective workforce.

We wanted to take a deeper look at some of the more abstract aspects of workplace design that can impact employee performance. An emerging suite of literature and research--including our 2013 [Workplace Survey ](http://www.gensler.com/uploads/documents/2013_US_Workplace_Survey_07_15_2013.pdf)-- clearly points to the power of choice and autonomy to drive not only employee happiness, but also motivation and performance. We found that knowledge workers whose companies allow them to help decide when, where, and how they work were more likely to be satisfied with their jobs, performed better, and viewed their company as more innovative than competitors that didn't offer such choices.

Take the technology workers in our survey, for example. Even though tech workspaces are more likely to be open-plan, [a design that's often seen as a distracting productivity-killer](https://hbr.org/2013/11/research-cubicles-are-the-absolute-worst/), tech workers in our survey reported an above-average ability to focus.

Our research also found that tech employees are also happier and more satisfied in their jobs and with their workplaces, than average.

Why are they so satisfied? Choice was a key differentiator: Forty-one percent of the technology employee respondents reported having a say in when and where they work -- which includes both in- and out-of-office mobility -- compared to only 32 percent on average.

Facebook is a prime example. At their headquarters, employees have the ability to tailor the layout, height, and configuration of their own desks based on personal preference. Teams can also create whatever workspace layout best supports their project, moving desks into a circular break-out space or a long row of desks, for example. There are also vast arrays of meeting spaces across the campus available to all employees. And Facebook offers a range of options to employees for managing their personal lives and time, ranging from the transactional (banks, cleaners) to the social (restaurants, arcades) and those that lie somewhere in between (woodshop, studio). This additional layer of choice may not seem immediately work-related, but the ability to create and control one's entire day as the needs of work dictate puts employees squarely in control of their own time management, productivity and processes. This [has been shown](http://www.choixdecarriere.com/pdf/6573/Baard_Deci_Ryan%282004%29.pdf) to lead to greater organizational productivity and suggests that meeting an employee's need for autonomy can influence motivation and performance.

Not every company can offer choice to employees on the same scale. But all organizations should carefully consider what they can do to give employees the spaces and tools that enhance and support their workday tasks as well as corporate goals. Choice is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Rather, it's specific to the organization and its needs.

The recent [Yahoo! recall](http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/25/technology/yahoo-work-from-home/index.html) seems to indicate that the organization's remote work policy was no longer a type of choice that supported Marissa Mayer's stated goal of enhancing innovation. Instead, she wanted a shared workplace that would encourage face-to-face interaction, idea sharing, serendipitous interactions, and informal meetings. A work environment with few assigned desks, cafes, lounge-style seating areas, and plenty of relaxed gathering spaces both inside and outside an office are just some of the physical design solutions that support innovation, while still offering choice.

At the global commercial real estate services firm [CBRE's](http://www.cbre.com/EN/Pages/Home.aspx) new office in Los Angeles, there are no assigned offices or workspaces; instead, employees can choose from 15 different space typologies based on their activities and needs each day (from collaboration rooms, to comfy couches, to acoustically-treated, single-person glass enclaves.) To encourage this mobility and flexibility, CBRE provided employees with work-from-anywhere mobile technology and created a paperless office environment by digitizing almost all paper files. The firm literally and figuratively brought the walls down to encourage collaboration across divisions, increase productivity, and enable their employees to work in a whole new way.

Workplace choice is just one part of a broader culture of autonomy. With the support of organizational policy, and the right alignment of tools and technology to optimize productivity, it allows workers to optimize their own job performance, leaving them more satisfied, motivated, and creative - exactly the sort of employees you need to deliver high performance.
