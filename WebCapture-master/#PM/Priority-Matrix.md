THE PRIORITY MATRIX DIFFERENCE
Step away from the linear to do list
we’re adding a whole new dimension to organization.

Prioritize visually with our unique approach that keeps you focused on the important things, because time spent doing the wrong thing is time wasted.

Focus on the right things, so you have time for the important things.

The Eisenhower Method — a concept invented by President Eisenhower — is one of a million ways to use Priority Matrix.

Crucial & need to be done now
Crucial & and need to be done later
Delegate non-crucial but time sensitive tasks
Uncategorized or repository inbox of ideas


|  | Do Now | Do Later |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Critical  | MANAGE critical and do now catastrophes deadlines emergencies. These hard-to-plan-for tasks are often unexpected and need to be dealt with as soon as possible. Don’t worry though, you’ve got this. | PRIORITIZE critical but do later preparations, relationships, development. These tasks are required for company growth. Spend most of your time here proactively. |
| Not Critical | REDUCE not critical but requires attention interruptions, (most) emails, (many) meetings. These small interruptions cause large rifts in your productivity. Spend less time here and delegate them out using Priority Matrix. | REPOSITORY just your ist of ideas, brainstorm, low priority items. Don’t let LIFO (last in, first out) stifle your productivity. Use this quadrant to track your ideas, and when the time is right, move them into the proper buckets. |

## THE EISENHOWER PARADIGM

> “What is important 
is seldom urgent 
and what is urgent 
is seldom important.”
