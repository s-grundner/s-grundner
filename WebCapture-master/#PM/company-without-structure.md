# Company Without Structure

_Captured: 2017-07-28 at 16:41 from [yihuo.de](http://yihuo.de/articles/150?utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=bufferbd0fd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com)_

In APAC region, there is a team based company. In this company, there is no hierarchy, no report lines, no performance evaluation, everyone decide his own salary. This company doesn't want to become big, actually it grow like virus and scale like cells.

The company is called **Odd-e** and we run 3 kinds of business mainly.

  * Training - we deliver agile related trainings such as CSM, CSPO, LeSS, engineering courses etc in APAC
  * Coaching - we support companies in different industries such as banking, internet, telecom, healthcare in their agile transition. The coaching typically have 3 focuses including organization coaching, team coaching and individual coaching. 
  * Startup - we run our own startups at the same time we collaborate with some other startups. So far, we have startups on DNA testing, cross-boarder e-commerce, social marketing, online travel agency. 

In this company, even though everyone can make decision, we have some rules. So, **Odd-e is a team based company driven by common vision and rules**.

**Odd-e is a Team Based Company**

Odd-e is made of many team companies, which is similar to Scrum team. Each team company is responsible for itself. Each team needs to manage its of profit and loss, decide what business to run and decide its own hiring. No team have more than 7 employees. If there are too many, our strategy is to split into multiple team companies just like cells. We have 8 teams in APAC including Singapore, Philippine, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Shanghai, Hang Zhou, Hong Kong and Sydney. It seems we will have US team very soon.

The advantage of team based companies is that no hierarchy. It is quite easy to make decision together and our collaboration within team is very close. We trust our team members behave like adult and adults don't want to work under supervision. Each team has its own cadence and working agreement. I will share how Odd-e Shanghai team works later in article.

Team based company also means finance independence. Each team is responsible for its own Profit & Loss. Each team runs its own business. There is no dependency between teams. Some times we have competition between each other because we run similar businesses in same market. But we see this as necessary, healthy competition will challenge each team to provide different services. Certainly we have more collaboration between teams.

> _Odd-e family gathering - July 2014, Chiang Mai, Thailand_

The challenges with team based companies is that we don't need a mother company. Why stay in Odd-e? In order to facilitate communication and collaboration across teams, we have a half-year Odd-e gathering. This is a good chance, employees from different teams meet with each other, co-work. The format is like a big open space. On Monday and each morning, we propose new ideas/topic to discuss, then we vote and choose focus. We will also have a half-year scrum, each participant share his/her experience, learnings and plans. Because Odd-e Shanghai is growing quite fast, we also have a quarterly gathering on our own. At company gatherings, we share what we learned, some tools/tips, new business opportunities, plans for collaboration between teams.

Bas Vodde is the founder of Odd-e and he works in Singapore team. He is the key enabler of Odd-e culture so far. Initially, he supported most Odd-e teams in different regions, however he never makes decision for teams. Instead, he tries everything to remove himself as dependency of operation of teams.

**Odd-e Global**

Odd-e has a global company, but for us it is only a bank account. Each team can contribute a x% of quarterly revenue to the account. The contribution is not a obligation but a advice. Team can decide to contribute more, 0 is also ok. But contribution from some teams will create peer pressure on other teams. We use money in global bank account to sponsor new teams and our gatherings.

**Odd-e is a Brand**

For most of us, we can survive and have decent income in our own market. Then why Odd-e? We are adults who believe in Odd-e brand. We care about and do everything to protect and increase the impact of the brand.

**Odd-e is a company without Values**

> _Odd-e Never Does_

We are in training and coaching business, such that we get chance to enter many companies, most are very famous. After visiting so many famous companies, we discovered an interesting pattern - company with values rarely conform to its values. It seems the company value system doesn't work as expected. In 2012 Singapore company gathering, we raised this issue and have a deep discussion. We decided to be negative, to define company Never-Does, which proved to be more effective than company values.

  * Never controls ideas
  * Never forgets the original hacker culture
  * Never does performance evaluation
  * Never sells software development tools
  * Never optimizes only for profit or growth
  * Never has others control your schedule
  * Never makes it too busy to spend time with family
  * Never forgets to have fun
  * Never gives up writing code together
  * Never hires people just because we have work
  * Never limits our thinking to one perspective

We also discussed vision for our organization and we got one - "build better product and help others build products". IMHO, it doesn't work either. I will share more later in how Odd-e Shanghai works. First let me explain some of Never-Does first.

**Never Control Others' Time**

We only hire Adult, which means each employee can work without supervision. Each team decides its own business objectives and to-do list. Each team member sign up work based on his capacity, interests, time and skill. If there is new customer lead and we need more help, we will share information at mailing group, slack or wechat group, "hey, this client engagement quite interesting and challenging, the product is a X-Ray machine including software and hardware. Who want to commit?". And then we have a team. Sometimes, there is no response, which means no one interested in work with this client, so we just say NO to the client.

**Never Do Performance Evaluation and Decide Own Salary**

Each employee have fixed salary and the salary is decided on our own. Anyone can propose anytime, if no one disagree, then it is ok. Many new employees had hard time decide the initial salary when they join Odd-e. But if he can change anytime, whether the initial amount is accurate or not becomes less important. We also found performance evaluation does more harm than good. So we never want to use that. But how do we motivate our people?

Back to the concept of Adult, we only need self-motivated people. We don't want team members who need external motivators to take action. **Transparency** is one of our core values. Every adult will have access to all relevant information, so he can make his own informed decision.

We believe each of our employee can make wise judgement based on factors such as his own need, families needs, living conditions, contribution to the team, shared team costs etc. The prerequisite of self-setting salary is financial transparency. Everyone knows everyone's salary. Each month, I will send out all records of company bank account, we also maintain a burn-flat chart which indicates company business value (our invoices and account balance). With such transparency, it is not hard to make financial decisions. If money is no longer a motivator, we can pursue more meaningful purposes.

****Never optimize for growth, Never hire people because we have work****

Most companies want to grow big, but that's not our value. Even if sometimes we are under pressure from clients who ask us to send more people to help them, we still don't want to grow. We thought the people we hired under customer pressure are not the kind of people we enjoy working with. On the other hand, even if we don't have enough work and we found someone interesting, we will still consider hiring him. An interesting metaphor of our hiring is marriage, we want to marry to people we enjoy live together. If we found one, we will try to date with him, know more about him, engage and marry. We also want people with diversified skill set and different background.

We don't use Job Description to find people too. And we don't like people who use CV to look for a job. Sometimes some friend asked how I can join Odd-e. My answer is "I am sorry, if I tell you, then you are not our people". We believe in craftsman, who look for job with his previous work/art. Typically, we will also challenge an new-comer to think about where our team bottleneck is and try to do something about it. Show to the rest of team instead of just telling.

Another key challenge for adult is to be able to think from customer perspective, solve end-to-end problem. Unlike most tranditional organization structure, we don't have department such as marketing, finance, HR, IT, R&D, support. Each employee have the capability to deal with end-to-end problem. This doesn't mean everyone is expert on each steps. Just as a sport team, we swarm on problem and support each other. Sometimes, we will fail, we learned from such lessons, we try to automate it or create team agreement to make it better next time.

**Odd-e Shanghai way of working**

![](http://res.yihuode.io/FnCjczMEB3DsCELY-viTrshH0fFx)

Each team is independent such that the way of working of each team are different either. As an example, I will explain how Odd-e Shanghai team works. In January 2013, Odd-e China team became too big and we are in 3 different cities. It would be a challenge to align all of us, so that we decided to split into Odd-e Shanghai, Odd-e Hangzhou and Odd-e Hong Kong. Actually until June 2016, only Odd-e Shanghai has 3 companies including Odd-e Shanghai, ULE Shanghai and ULE Hong Kong. After 3 years, in addition to agile training and coaching business, we now have 3 companies, 4 start-ups. As one team, we created our own rules. Let me explain how we work more:

Odd-e has half-yearly gathering and because Odd-e Shanghai became big, we now have our own gathering. We meet 3 days each quarter. Every month, no matter where we are, we will meet for one day in one of our offices in Shanghai or Hong Kong. At each gathering, we will discuss about long term objectives and business opportunities. Then we create idea backlog. The backlog may include items to business opportunities, market strategies, community, learning and sharing.

One example of such idea might be [AHA conference](http://aha.odd-e.com/). At one gathering, we talked about there are many conferences but it seemed we could learn much about it. So we decided to organize one and we call it AHA. We don't need to ask for permission from anyone. Just go ahead and organize it. [2016 AHA Conference](https://www.facebook.com/AhaConf/) turned out to be a huge success for us.

> _Starting from Aug. 2014, we adopted team barbel strategy. As a team_

  * On the safe side we spend 20% of passion and 80% of capacity to survive (get enough revenue to pay our salary and cost with traditional agile training and coaching business)
  * On the extreme side, we deliberately spend 80% of passion and 20% of capacity to gamble for our future. We call it throwing dices. 20% of team capacity means limited # of dedicated people or timebox our own effort. 

In the past 2 years, we tried a couple of new businesses and since mid 2015, this side became profitable and we are able to encounter more and more new business opportunities, now we have 4 start-ups including DNA testing, e-commerce, branding system and online travel.

**\- Weekly/Bi-weekly Scrum**

In general we run two types of business, training and coaching which are quite stable for us and start ups require us to adapt fast. So we set up two cadences.

**Safe side - bi-weekly scrum**

For training and coaching business, team members will discuss every two weeks. In the meetings, we will talk about financial situation, trainings, coaching as well as community

**Extreme side - weekly scrum**

There are more uncertainties on extreme side. The failure rate is much higher, but if we succeeded in one of them, the impact is huge. Because of the unstable nature, we use one week scrum. As team agreement, we don't arrange client work on Friday and we use this opportunity to discuss about issues, learnings from each start-up.

**Burn-flat**

Another interesting rule we applied in Shanghai team is burn-flat, which means we just want to make sure our bank account to have enough money to cover our salary and cost, even if we can make a lot of profit from the survival side. We use this to monitor our team stay in the grey area of certainty and uncertainty. The reason is very simple, if we have a lot of money in our bank account which are from our main business (survival side), no one want to change. People only change when under pressure.

**Ever-eolving Visions and Agreement**

Each team has its own rule and make its own business decision, we still have agreement. For Odd-e Shanghai, every weekly/bi-weekly scrum is opportunity for us to discuss about agreement and shared vision. In Odd-e Shanghai, we had discussion about company vision. We thought it would be a joke if we just get our vision and agreement out of 1 day workshop. We believe necessary conflicts, turbulence will lead to real vision and agreement and the vision will evolve over time, such that we focus on a lot to have more turbulence and frequent retrospective. From such turbulence and built in cadence, we co-discovered and is co-discovering our vision and agreement.

**Now The Company Changed Again**

Each Odd-e team has its own way of working. Each team has its own cadence. Within Odd-e families, we shared with each other and support each other. The time you see this article, the way we work maybe changed again.

If you are interested, you will get to know more about attending my [upcoming Certified Scrum Master course](http://yihuode.io/activities/336) in Hong Kong.
