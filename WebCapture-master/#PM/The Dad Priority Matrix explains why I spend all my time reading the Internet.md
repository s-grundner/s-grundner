### The Dad Priority Matrix explains why I spend all my time reading the Internet

It’s been now almost a year since my last post here. Back then I was about to become a dad and witnessed first hand how different the experience was for me vs. my partner. [I saw how privileged I was as a man in our society](https://medium.com/@stenpittet/understanding-my-privileges-a13726b2003). Fast forward to today, our son is almost 7 months and I barely remember the time flying by. N. is a happy mom (I just asked) and being a new dad is amazing. I’m fascinated by the little things he learns everyday, the way he changed me as a person and how he also transformed my relationship with N.

Right, I need to speed things up as I think I only have 19 minutes before T. wakes up. Let me try to finish this post before that. Forgive the short sentence, the lack of structure and the grammar mistakes.

I’ve been wanting to write down my experience as a new dad for months now (basically, since he’s born) so that it may help others, but mostly for me, as it makes the hard moments fun as I look back at these experiences and try to find different meanings behind them. It’s also fun to try to apply some of the stuff I do for work to my new life as a parent.

So without further ado here’s the dilemma of the New Dad Priority Matrix

### The classic Priority Matrix

You can find a lot of documentation and great articles about the [Priority Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_Matrix). It’s a great tool that helps you recognise the things that you really need to do and the things that you can and should ignore.

The typical Priority Matrix

It’s fairly straightforward — do the stuff in the top right corner, and ignore those in the bottom left. If I map this to what’s currently in my head, it would look like the following.

My Priority Matrix

**Important and Urgent:**

  * Keeping baby clean
  * Keeping baby alive
  * Teaching baby things (for example, how to sleep).

**Important AND Not Urgent:**

  * Starting to write about this. It feels so great doing this now.

**Not Important and Not Urgent:**

  * Facebook, Twitter, Flipboard, Instagram…
  * Read the top 10 of Internet things.
  * Did you see these Youtube videos of babies? And puppies? And babies with puppies?

**Not Important and Urgent:**

  * I tried to think of something but I can’t find any. It’s like this part of my brain is turned off.

_Now, you might be wondering where my relationship with N. fits in there. Well, it’s in the Urgent AND Important section. But it’s overshadowed by all the baby things and this will be the topic of another post._

So, I’ve managed to fill in the matrix, I can also clearly see why I should not spend my time on the Internet and focus on doing other stuff that are more meaningful to me.

### But why is it that I’m spending so much time refreshing Facebook?

This is by no mean a diatribe against Facebook. I find it perfectly normal to spend time on it, and it’s a great way for me to connect with a lot of people that are scattered in different places. However I’ve surprised myself being stuck on things like The Lad Bible, Topito, and all other sorts of website requiring zero brain activity. Definitly not urgent and not important to do.

On the other side there’s plenty that may not be urgent, but that I really want to do more: getting new coding skills, drawing, learning how to play and produce music. But in the past 7 months I’ve hardly done any of that — the only thing I managed to keep up with was playing basketball at the weekly comp’.

So I looked back at the Priority Matrix and realised that if I changed one of the axis everything started to make sense.

The Dad Priority Matrix

I call this _The Dad Priority Matrix_. On one axis you have the importance of things and on the other axis you evaluate how long it takes you do those things.

  * **Important AND Short**  

You’ll drop whatever you’re doing to do that first. Most things that I do with / for my baby fits here.

  * **Important AND Long**  

Typically anything on your bucket list. Hard to get done because the _Important and Short_ things interrupt them.

  * **Not Important AND Short**  

You end up doing those things a lot because you can easily finish those task before picking an _Important and Short_ one (changing a nappy, moving baby away from dangerous table corner).

  * **Not Important AND Long**  

I couldn’t find anything for that.

### Finally, my Dad Priority Matrix explains everything

Now I can map my previous tasks to the Dad Priority Matrix, and everything starts to make sense.

My Dad Priority Matrix

As I wrote above, most of the things I do with my son are short-lived tasks. Feeding him, changing him, putting him to sleep, settling him again after we woke up, keeping him away from dangerous things — all those things are critical tasks (and urgent ones) but they also are not taking too much time (although putting him to sleep can vary in duration).

But the issue is that it’s hard to predict when the next baby task will occur and it’s hard to plan for long-lived tasks because of that. As a result it’s much easier to fill the gaps with other short-lived tasks that you won’t care too much about dropping off. In my case it involves picking up my phone and browsing social medias without really caring about it.

### We have to go out now

Hard transition, but Exhibit A of this post. T. is in the kitchen with N. now and I really have to go now. I wish I could proof read this (Important, Long Task) but I have to go to help on all the small things.

And don’t misunderstand what this is about: I love all the time I spend with T. and N. but it’s quite fun to try to turn life in diagrams and matrices.

Ok. I had time to finally proof read this in a café. In another blog post I’ll try to list tips and tricks to do _Important AND Long stuff_. Wish me luck.
