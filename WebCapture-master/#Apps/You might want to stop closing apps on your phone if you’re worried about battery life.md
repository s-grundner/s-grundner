Last week, Apple's top brass put to rest a widely held misconception. The common practice of closing all the apps on your iPhone [really doesn't do anything](http://qz.com/637485/that-one-trick-everybody-does-to-improve-iphone-battery-life-does-absolutely-nothing/) to improve the phone's battery life.

But what about Android phones? Well, who better to answer that question than Google's head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer?

After a friend reached out on Twitter to ask if the same rule held true for Android, I tagged Lockheimer in my response. And today (Mar. 14), he responded pretty categorically:

"Thrash," in the context of a computer, has nothing to do with heavy metal. It's when a hard drive [becomes overworked](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/thrash.htm) from moving information between the device's memory and virtual memory, meaning it could actually slow your phone down to be constantly closing apps for no reason.

I double-checked that Lockheimer was suggesting that Android owners just leave apps open (assuming they hadn't crashed):

So there it is. Unless an app is actively misbehaving, the head of Android suggests just leaving them all be.
