iOS: Editorial is [one of our favorite text editors on iOS](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-apps-for-any-kind-of-writing-1563998071). Today it gets a slew of new improvements for editing, automating, and writing.

As for writing, this update for Editorial brings along new templates and previews so it's easier to get into writing whatever you need to write. There's a new browser tab system as well, allowing you to have multiple web pages open for automating links while you're still in writing mode. On the editing end, you can now search and highlight a lot easier. The big improvement comes in a new folding and arranging paragraphs feature. Once turned on, you can easily move paragraphs around, or fold them up so they don't take up as much space. It's a huge boon to the editing process and makes larger documents a lot easier to manage.
