Here is an interesting take on just who are the most **influential indie Apple developers**, using a tool for ranking people's influence in their particular field, based on twitter and website stats.

It was developed by [Ross Dawson](http://rossdawson.com), who first used it to rank [KeyNote Speakers](http://rossdawson.com/keynote-speaker-influence-rankings/). You can find out more about the algorithm it uses from his detailed and fully-transparent explanation of [how it works](http://rossdawson.com/keynote-speaker-influence-rankings/#method).

As a result of my special association with him (yes, he's my brother), I had the opportunity to apply it to my own field of endeavour, and I think it does indeed provide a valuable insight into who the influencers really are. Note that I've included myself in the list, not so much for vanity as for the sake of having a good control point. ;-)

Selection criteria I used for appearing on this list  
1) Have developed successful Mac and/or iOS apps  
2) Write publicly via twitter and/or blog/website about app development, app store and Apple  
3) Be posting (only or mainly) as an independent developer i.e. have own website or blog  
4) Reasonably prominent - anyone scoring too low in this ranking system may be dropped from the table, for the sake of expediency and avoiding overload

**Please note** - I have compiled an initial list based on my own conjecture about who was reasonably prominent in this field. If you have a suggestion about who else to add, please let me know via twitter [@gpdawson](http://twitter.com/gpdawson). Note that the individual must have 1) a twitter account and 2) a website or blog for which they are the primary contributors. Generally, anyone with a company website with multiple contributors can't realistically be included without distorting the results.
