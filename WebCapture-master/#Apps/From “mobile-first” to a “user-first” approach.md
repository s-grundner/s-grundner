Media consumption habits provide key signals that can help brands create a more focused, relevant and memorable experience for users; at the same time creating a prime opportunity for marketers to understand and connect with their audience.

We are in a world that lives their Life On Screens™, an all-digital world where average consumers take care of their daily needs; everything from completing their education to entertainment and work-related tasks all as they go from one screen to the next.

But how does that user interaction provide insight that can be actionable by marketers? This technology-driven ecosystem can be mapped out and studied, to help brands achieve their core objective: to reach and engage consumers; establish a connection with their brand, and ultimately sell their product or service.

**Marketing to #MOMENTING**

A user named Jim's journey throughout the day, will show how this theory works. He is in a museum walking around when hunger strikes by lunch time. He executes a search on his smartphone for a place to eat and he immediately received a coupon, via his search results, to eat at Tim's Chicken Shack.

This was a perfectly timed opportunity for _Tim's Chicken Shack_ based on Jim's specific data: time of day, location, device and intent.

We call this approach "Momenting".

**How it works**

Brands know where Jim is: a museum; what he wants to do: eat; what screen he had that interaction on: a phone. These "signals" paint a picture that helps meet any consumer's expectations, which is the ultimate goal.

Now marketers have the ideal situation to engage and persuade users with the right content at the right moment.

In this case, a specific food brand sent Jim a coupon at the exact time he was looking for a place to eat, but that same theory could work for any user.

> _M8's "Momenting" Methodology Framework_

Think "user-first". The "mobile-first" idea is just one piece of the puzzle, not the entire thing. In other words, it does not satisfy all the variables of a relevant experience delivery.

Another situation: a user named Diane is at work and is interested in shoes. She performed a simple Google search, and during her drive home she checked her Facebook via their app. Instantly, a sponsored article about the top shoe trends appear on her feed. Once again a user got what they were looking for when they were looking for it. An interaction that started on a computer screen ended with a transaction on a smartphone.

As a result, brands can build equity, create loyalty and, ultimately, help consumers' lives. All this is possible by interpreting, facilitating and enriching their Life On Screens™.
