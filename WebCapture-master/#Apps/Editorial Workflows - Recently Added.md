> This workflow displays document text as preformated html text, searches the document for a specified keyword, and styles it using css. Useful for syntax highlighting or keyword highlighting. Can also be adapted to use for text formatting. This is a work in progress. Feel free to enhance and re-upload. I am having issues with space right now. 
> 
> Enhanced statistics workflow that includes estimated reading time for selection. You can change the Words Per Minute rate in the red workflow action. The default is 200 WPM (average adult reading time), but time to read aloud should be calculated using a lower rate (such as 80 to 150 WPM) determined by user's average rate of delivery. Rest of workflow is the same one bundled with Editorial. Shows statistics about the selected text(word count etc.). If no text is selected, the statistics refer to the entire document.
> 
> UI for creating a daily summery and send it to Day One. 
> 
> Copies all text in the selected document to the clipboard, optionally converting Markdown to HTML.
> 
> Takes a list of filenames from a current file and pastes their content in the cursor position. Useful for merging bigger documents.
> 
> Pastes contents of selected files into the current file. Files are sorted alphabetically. Based on the "Folder list" workflow. 
> 
> Opens selected file in a sidebar. Every change is automatically saved. Based on "List folder" workflow. Folder is set inside the workflow. It may be not so elegant, but it does the job for me.
> 
> This workflow allows a selected Bible reference to be looked up in the English Standard Version, through Crossway's API, and returned as a markdown footnote. See related workflow for a blockquote format at http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/6398031989571584/a3n-NNsLNc0 Footnote workflow modified from Federico Viticci's "New Footnote" Workflow. 
> 
> Will select current line, then give choices for action - copy with doc url for pasting manually elsewhere - copy to tp doc ( set URL in variable) with doc url and return back to current doc
> 
> Copies browser title URL and selected text from editorial browser and then pastes into current doc in MD format. Now with option menu to choose between copy to clipboard, insert in doc at current cursor position or insert to a taskpaper doc ( set this in the open URL action )
> 
> Title capitalization workflow. More info: http://bit.ly/1qqRfvx www.movingelectrons.net 
> 
> Generate customized HTML with advanced settings. 
> 
> NOTE: This workflow is designed for iPad only. Shows a Markdown preview of the current document in a sidebar panel, next to the editor. The preview is updated automatically as you type, and it preserves its scroll position. Links that you tap on in the preview are opened in the browser panel.
> 
> Creates a task at Toodledo. Designed to be used in a workflow as a task.
> 
> This workflow lists all H1 headings in the document in a popover and moves the caret to the subsequently selected heading. The difference from the built-in version is that the selected heading appears at the top of the screen (unless it is on the final screen of the document). To achieve this, the workflow briefly flicks to the end of the document. Hopefully this is barely perceptible. 
> 
> This workflow opens Prizmo in scan mode, OCRs text and puts it on the clipboard and then pastes the text at the caret position in the editor or just returns focus to Editorial with the OCR'd text in the clipboard, depending on which option the user chooses. A third alternative has been added where user can choose to place OCR text in a new timestamped txt file in either Dropbox or local storage. (Fixed bug so that instruction to create file in Dropbox is carried out)
> 
> Moves @done tasks in a TaskPaper document to the archive (created if necessary). If a task is in a project, a @project(name) tag is appended automatically. Note that this ignores indentation and doesn't handle sub-projects though.
> 
> Workflow gets selected text in browser and clips it to new md file in local storage. User can opt to input custom filename terms which will be appended to timestamp. 
> 
> This workflow gets selected text and clips it to a new md file with timestamp in local storage. User can opt to add custom terms to file name, otherwise filename is "[timestamp] Clip.md".

> 
> Place a cursor on any line and activate the workflow. Upon each activation, the workflow will successively increment the line from its current header level to the next header level. So, no header is incremented to H1. H1 is incremented to H2, and so on through H6. H6 increments to no header.
> 
> Takes the md text, converts it to HTML then pastes it into a new email with the subject being the title of the file.
> 
> This workflow opens Prizmo in scan mode, OCRs text and puts it on the clipboard and then pastes the text at the caret position in the Editorial editor. Removing the second workflow block should just return focus to Editorial with OCR text in the clipboard, ready to paste wherever. If someone could modify this to allow for either option to be chosen, that would be great. Similar to the workflow quoted above with the choice added to paste the text or keep it on the clipboard. Fixed missing '1'.
> 
> Takes selected text from browser page, wraps in quotes, and places link adjacent to quoted text after a colon. 
> 
> Takes selected or inputted text as search terms and executes either a Google search or a search for legal precedent in Google Scholar (user chooses which), and displays search results in Editorial's browser.

> 
> Wraps current selection in [[square brackets]]. If no text is selected, it just wraps the cursor.
> 
> Copies line text text to fantastical new event, calendar specified in variable, with link to doc stored in URL field. 
> 
> Get Contact by @jollipixel It's meant to be used as a Subworkflow. Prompts for a name (could be partial name) and returns '' from your Contacts as a string. Will present a list if multiple matches are found.
> 
> Get Email Address by @jollipixel It's meant to be used as a Subworkflow. Prompts for a name (could be partial name) and returns '' from your Contacts as a string. Will present a list if multiple matches are found.
> 
> Get Phone Number by @jollipixel It's meant to be used as a Subworkflow. Prompts for a name (could be partial name) and returns '' from your Contacts as a string. Will present a list if multiple matches are found.
> 
> LCP Preset Messages by @jollypixel This workflow creates Launch Center Pro action list of preset messages from selected lines in the editor (uses all text if no selection) and adds an option to type new message. Each line may contain TAB separated Label and Message. It will search your Contacts for given name and present a list if there are more than one matching name or number. Allows to save, copy to clipboard, email tappable link or install action in LCP.
> 
> Searches for legal precedent in Google Scholar and displays search results in Editorial's browser. 
> 
> This workflow invokes Pushbullet actions. First it pops up a menu asking what the user wants to push, either a note from selected (or all) text in the editor, or a note from text in clipboard, or a link. If the choice is to push a link, another menu pops up asking if the source of the link is the clipboard or the current in-app browser URL. The latter function is especially useful, obviously, when the workflow is invoked from the in-app browser bookmark menu. 
> 
> Insert an image reference from the current web page
> 
> Custom UI to search the App Store for iPhone, iPad and Mac apps. Supports affiliate links. If no text is selected, will set the raw link, else it sets a Markdown link (title and everything). 1.0
> 
> Sends the selected document via email, optionally converting it from Markdown to HTML.
> 
> Copies the title and editorial link of a document to your main taskpaper document ready to be pasted in. Useful to follow up on a document in progress. Nb. Change the URL of the open URL stage to reflect the doc URL of your taskpaper file. 
> 
> Copies browser title URL and selected text from editorial browser and then pastes into current doc in MD format. 
> 
> Use to email a preformatted message with site name and URL from editorial browser info filled in. 
> 
> Workflow uses Python script to open UI file picker for Dropbox. Files from Dropbox then saved in 'Local' folder in Editorial. Python script from @olemoritz Github post at: https://gist.github.com/omz/fb180c58c94526e2c40b
> 
> A custom CSS preview in progress. It should be usable at this point. Note that is is not for multimarkdown at this time.
> 
> AFTER you open a new file for a big idea, run this script to set up the titles and sections.
> 
> Duplicates current file and creates the copy as an .html file.
> 
> Grabs current line and creates an h1 from it.
> 
> will select the current line and then search on fantastical for that text Useful with taskpaper format files.
> 
> Sends the selected document via email, optionally converting it from Markdown to HTML.
> 
> Searches the current line in due.app useful for checking if you have already entered a task in due, Works with taskpaper format files.
> 
> A port of the doing recording concept popularised by @ttscoff, Adapted so that you can record to a file called "tp-doing.taskpaper" the following: date, time, website title and url from editorial browser, the selected text in your document, the document url in editorial and you can also add extra text. This is good for posting quick reminders of what you are working on so you can record your progress on a task, or go back to some previous notes. Use the Open-doing workflow to quickly open the tp-doing.taskpaper file, to remember what you were doing. Now with HUD at end to confirm file updated. V1.2 with text from prompt incorporated into entry better. V1.1 hour and min variables now in correct order 
> 
> Use to quickly create markdown page breaks or decksets breaks (would like to improve this to automatically count 5 lines then create next break - will look at how to do that)
> 
> Use with the TP-doing workflow to quickly review what you have been up to and get back into your tasks quickly. Inspired by the concepts from @ttscoff.

> This workflow is designed to send an email to a large number of people using the BCC field (This is why it requires the Drafts action to actually send it. Otherwise, the whole thing could be done within Editorial.) It depends on a text file with a list of emails, one per line in your file browser. I use an Automator script running on a Mac to create mine. My Mac mini is set to run this script every day very early in the morning. That way, I always have an updated list of emails. This workflow makes liberal use of conditional blocks for the purpose of being able to 'fold' repeated actions out of the way and thereby make the workflow less unwieldy. It has the following parameters that should be changed to fit your particular situation: - The name of your text file with your list of emails in it. This should be set in the action 'Get Email List' located right after the first block of conditionals. - The number of emails per variable (or Small List). This is set by the 'interval' parameter in the 'Split Email List Into Small Lists By "interval":' action. Remember, there are up to 11 variables in this workflow so plan accordingly. It will only use the variables that have emails in them. But it can not create more on the fly. - In the 'Set Subject of Email' action within the 'Prepare Text' block you can enter the subject of your email. This assumes it will be the same subject every time you send this email. I put the current month in mine so that it's not exactly the same subject every month. - The body of the email will be the full text of the current document. I write the email in Markdown and often include pictures and links. The workflow will convert it to HTML. - The last few actions prepare a template for the next time you will send this email. You'll want to set the 'Number', 'Unit' and 'Output Format' in the 'Date Math' action to line up with your plans. - Set the value in the 'Next Month's Name' action to match what you want the template to be named. I use date math to pre-name it for next month. - In the last action, 'Next Month's Name', set the template for the body of the next occurrence's email. I include this month's text at the bottom so I can see what I wrote last month. - You'll also want to click [the following link](drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=email&name=MonthlyMail&to=&cc=&bcc=%5B%5Bclipboard%5D%5D&subjecttype=0&subject=%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&markdown=1&background=0&fromprefix=&template=%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D) to create the corresponding Drafts action: drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=email&name=MonthlyMail&to=&cc=&bcc=%5B%5Bclipboard%5D%5D&subjecttype=0&subject=%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&markdown=1&background=0&fromprefix=&template=%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D You can rename the Drafts action anything you like, just be sure to change the name of the Drafts action you call in each of the urls in the 'Cascade Through Short Lists' block to match the name of the Drafts action, if you do change it. Note: You will have to press the send button once per 'Short List' in Drafts. This can be changed to send automatically, but it will not come from your email, it will come from drafts-mail@agiletortoise.com instead. I prefer to send it from my own email address. Note 2: This workflow has not been thoroughly tested and debugged. I believe it to be relatively free of trouble, so let me know if you have any issues by starting a thread in the forum. :-) Thanks to Ole for creating the date math script and helping to nail down the script that splits the long list into smaller ones! Enjoy!

> # md->html_pdf_tex v.2.1 ## Authors: * Maurizio Manuguerra (maurizio.manuguerra@gmail.com) * Robert Quinn ## Introduction This set of routines has been written with the idea that markdown files can be the origin of a plethora of formats and kind of documents. Specifically, md files can be converted to html, pdf, tex files, and both the LaTeX "article" and "beamer" classes are supported. **The same source files can be used to generate a quick report, an article or a presentation.** Tables, equations (via MathJax) and images (local and remote) are supported in all the formats. ## Use This workflow starts from a md file and the user can preview the html generated and choose between these options: 1. Export the html file. Remote images are temporarely downloaded and all the images are embedded in the html file in base64 encoding. Formulas are rendered via MathJax. 2. Upload of the html and images files to a web service of choice. 3. Creation of LaTeX files, either in class "article" or "beamer". The .tex file generated is both copied in the clipboard and included in a zip file with all the images used in md file. Remote images are downloaded to create the zip file and then deleted. Use Reedle Documents, any other suitable app or a computer to unzip the project file and move the folder in your LaTeX compiler of choice. I have tested with a LaTeX installation on OSX, Texpad for iOS and Tex Writer for iOS and it works out-of-the-box for my need. ## Conventions in LaTeX For both article and beamer presentations, the title is taken from the filename. For the article class, > #: section > ##: subsection > ### or more: subsubsection For the beamer (presentation) class, > #: section > ##: subsection > ###: frame (i.e. slide) > #### or more: subsubsection Please note that no proprietary command is needed to start a slide. Instead, as the idea is to use the same file to generate multiple types of documents, the triple hash ("###") is used. ## Future work * Support for citations (bibtex). * Support for footnotes. V2.1: * the FTP server address has to be defined in the workflow. V.2.0: * UI redesign (for Editorial 1.1) * possibility to upload to an ftp host the article or the presentation (the latter requires deck server-side). V1.3: * LaTex tables: relevant characters for LaTex tables (e.g. &) are not escaped any more. Tables now work. * LaTex tables: \hline now inserted between headers and body. V1.2: * html5 presentations, when exported, are now uploaded to a web hosting service thorugh ftp. * horizontal-slide.css commented out as doesn't work on some platforms * images are no more embedded in preview presentation as don't always work correctly

> Modified version of Clean Up Completed Tasks workflow. Intended to be run every now and then on a Main.taskpaper file to empty the archive by filtering lines tagged as @done and prepending them to an Archive.taskpaper. The lack of disclosure triangles in Editorial means having to look at that eventually unwieldy archive, but I don't always want to just delete completed tasks. Thanks to @scottzero for the original workflow this is based on. Note: all I did was change the filenames (and paths) in the proper actions and then change the line filtering to @done.

> My todo list lives in two text files within /Dropbox/Editorial/Todo. These are todo.md and done.md. Todo.md contains headers to define separate different sections (#Today at the very top, followed by #Tomorrow, #Work, #Home, etc.). The very last section is #Inbox, which allows me to append to the file quickly from elsewhere for quick additions to be categorized later. Within each section is a bulleted list of tasks. When a task is completed, I prepend its line with "x YYYY-MM-DD" using the previously shared workflow "Mark Task Completed", or in a desktop text editor. This workflow removes completed tasks from the current text file (if and only if it's called todo.md), and prepends them to done.md.

> Prepends "x YYYY-MM-DD" to the current line, to complete a task. This is in the style of the todo.txt GTD system. (Previous version had a typo in the description, and was written hastily before realizing it would be shared on the website.)
> 
> Pretends "x YYYY-MM-DD" to the current line, to complete a task, todo.txt style. 
> 
> Appends selected text, whether in the browser or editor to what is in the clipboard. Useful for copying several things to the clipboard without loosing what was orginally copied. Note: copy the first text, and use this workflow for all subsequent copies. Add this workflow as a browser bookmark as well.
> 
> Takes markdown and copies it to the clipboard as HTML without smart quotes and without smart apostrophes. Great if you just use basic markdown and want readable HTML code, such as for writers.
> 
> Here is a question: Is a lightbulb hot or cold? Boolean logic says that it is either hot or cold. However, fuzzy logic takes into consideration that the words hot and cold are relative. If an ice cube is considred the coldest of cold, and the sun is considered the hottest of hot, then perhaps a lightbulb is not just hot or cold, but some smaller DEGREE of hot and cold. In this way, fuzzy logic allows for more human-like logic by describing things in terms of their degree of truth. Fuzzy values are values between 0 and 1 while boolean values are either 0 or 1. This app takes three parameters: Minimum value Maximum value Value Between It calculates the degree of a value between the two values and outputs a sentence explaining the calculation. This is for my personal use, but perhaps someone else might find it useful. I will update this perahaps as a custom action in the future.

> Retorna una llista de sinonims per la paraula seleccionada o la paraula introduida per l'usuari i la reemplaça o inserta la seleccionad al document. Aquest workflow funciona gracies a l'OpenThesaurus-ca, un diccionari catala de sinonims i associacions lliure. La API te una limitacio de 60 peticions per minut des de la mateixa adreça IP. Tota la documentacio del projecte aixi com l'acces al diccionari en linia es pot trobar a http://openthesaurus.softcatala.org Agraiments a Joan Montane i Michael Karneim. 
> 
> Search the AppStore, open or copy link to found apps Queries the iTunes Store API to search for Mac, iPhone, or iPad apps using either the current selection or the user's input. Results are displayed in a popover with the app's name and price (in USD). Selecting an app from the popover will prompt you to either view the app in the AppStore or copy the AppStore URL to the clipboard. 
> 
> A workflow that uses xmlrpc to scale and upload images directly to a WordPress blog. You can choose to name the image, resize or use the original size. The image will upload to the Wordpress image library, create thumbnails and link articles automatically. A markdown image link link will be created and the selected text is used as alt text for the image. More info at: http://www.jackenhack.com
> 
> A collection of three workflows to show how the new GUI system can be used to make a private app. Feel free to customize to you liking. 
> 
> Copies an editorial:// bookmark URL for the selected document. This URL can be used to open the document on this device (from Editorial or other apps).
> 
> 2do inbox copies the input text line into the note which is useful if there is a URL on the line. Sets the task text to the selected text in the document. Puts the task into the Inbox list in the 2do task app. Updated to remove the editorial doc URL as this was not proving useful. 
> 
> Sends the Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX text that is currently in the editor to the web service Docverter for conversion into Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, EPUB, or even DOCX. Allows users to turn on several options for Docverter, which uses Pandoc for text conversion. For Markdown, HTML, and LaTeX output, users can choose whether to replace the editor text with the converted text or to place the converted text onto the clipboard. For file output, the workflow will prompt the user to open the returned PDF, EPUB, or DOCX file in an appropriate app. By configuring the red actions in the workflow, users can create custom CSS styles for PDF output can be defined in workflow action and specify a folder where the workflow can look for files referenced by Docverter arguments that require files, such as "template." Requires Editorial 1.1.1. Please report bugs on Twitter.

> This very simple workflow makes the editor an html editor. It comes with example html from W3Schools. Copy the text in the html variable into the editor. To see the example. In the next version I will have a GUI to aide in the process.
> 
> Opens a Google Drive folder (edit the url in this code to show your own public folder), asks for the photo name you want to embed, and the file type, and creates a markdown photo link (edit this to your own folder url too).
> 
> Change beginning if line to have a dash. Making line suitable for taskpaper workflow. Works at any position on the line.

> Custom UI to crop images and save the output to the Camera Roll.
> 
> Allows you to send text to Writer Pro, in a workflow state chosen from a list when ran. Can use selected text or defaults to all text with no selection made. I don't see myself using Writer Pro much at this time, but I see others using it and decided to try it out since it was on sale. As of now, and as far as I can tell, it has no x-callback support.

> This workflow allows a selected Bible reference to be looked up in the English Standard Version, through Crossway's API, and returned as a markdown block quote beneath the reference. Current known issues: * If the selected text contains non-unicode characters, the python script that pulls the selected verse from the Crossway API will throw an error. This could be fixed fairly easily, I believe, by doing a replace, but I don't know Regex well enough right now to replace non-unicode characters with their unicode equivalent.
