  1. 1Writer can be configured to behave somewhat like Drafts but I find Drafts to be faster and more convenient in almost every way. 1Writer is still a great iOS app though. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  2. I wish I didn't have to use Dropbox but it's still the only way to sync text between every major app I use. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  3. There's [a nice tutorial](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204861807-Action-Step-Prompt) over on the Drafts Web site. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  4. Emoji for collection names are a lot more compact that written words. These are readable and I don't have to scroll to find a collection.[5](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html) [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  5. Did you know you can slide on the bottom of the action menu to switch tabs? Crazy. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  6. Pinswift provides general private search, network search and full text searching options. I use them all. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)

  7. This may not stay in taskpaper files forever. I really like the options I get when I store lists in iThoughts. I also name the iThoughts file with the "@list" tag. It's an ongoing experiment but I've used this text files for at least 10 years. [↩](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/01/getting-drafts-right-for-2016.html)
