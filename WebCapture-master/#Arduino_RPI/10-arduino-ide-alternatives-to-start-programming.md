When we start developing an Arduino project, usually we tend to use the **Arduino IDE**. There are, anyway, several Arduino IDE alternatives we should consider if we are not satisfied with the standard IDE. As we know, Arduino is one of the most popular prototyping boards (with several alternatives) when we are building a DIY project.

Usually, the Arduino IDE is the first IDE we use when approaching the first time to Arduino. This happens for several reasons: it is easy to use, it supports all the Arduino boards, and it has a built-in library manager that is also easy to use. Moreover, the Arduino IDE is very user-friendly without too many options, menus, and so on that could scare an inexperienced user. It is so easy that we do not have to worry about how it works, we can focus only on the development process. We write the Arduino code, and the Arduino IDE compiles it and uploads the compiled code into the Arduino board. That's it!.

Moreover, it is open source and runs on several OS, such as Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Anyway, if you do not feel comfortable with Arduino IDE, there are several alternatives you can use when developing your Arduino project. There are some missing features in Arduino IDE that could bother you, especially if you are used to IDE, like Eclipse, Visual Studio, or IntelliJ, just to name a few. One missing feature in Arduino IDE that really bothers me is the autocomplete. That is a way to predict the rest of the commands so that you do not have to write it all. There are some other features I like in an IDE, such as showing function parameters, hints related to the syntax error, and so on.

## Arduino IDE Alternative List

This article will provide a list of Arduino IDE alternatives you can use when creating your Arduino project, if you do not like the standard Arduino IDE. The order is random. Enjoy!

### PlatformIO

![platformio logo Arduino IDE](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/platformio-logo.png)

is one the most known Arduino IDE alternative. It has an integrated development environment for IoT. It supports not only Arduino boards but many other boards, such as Raspberry, ESP32, ESP8266, and many others. The IDE supports all the features you would expect, like code completion and so on. It is not only an IDE, but it has a CLI (Command Line Interface) support too. Moreover, the PlatformIO supports multi-projects, themes, and library management. The interface is very attractive and easy to use. However, it is very different from the standard Arduino IDE. It is open source and you can download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/platformio). It requires Python and runs on several OS. This Arduino IDE has two different versions: one built on top of Atom and another one as Visual Studio code plugin. If you want more informationon how to use PlatfomIO, you can refer to this [article](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/2016/07/arduino-alternative-ide.html).

### Eclipse Arduino IDE

![Eclipse Arduino IDE](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eclipse-arduino.png)

This is a plugin for Eclipse. We all know Eclipse and the IDE. If you program in Java, you had the chance to test and appreciate the [Eclipse IDE](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-c-ide-arduino) features. It is almost a standard in the IDE. Eclipse is a very versatile environment that supports several programming languages, ranging from Jave to C/C++ and so on. This platform uses the plugins to extend its features and add new platform support.

This is a plugin for Eclipse IDE that helps to develop Arduino applications. You can download the plugin directly from the Eclipse Marketplace. Of course, it requires you to install the Eclipse C++ IDE. Once, this plugin is installed in Eclipse IDE, you have to select the platform or, in other words, the SDK that includes all the libraries necessary to build the application. Once the plugin is configured, you are ready to develop your Arduino sketch. The IDE is essentially the Eclipse IDE, so if you are familiar with Eclipse, you do not have problems to use it. This Arduino IDE has all the features you have in the standard Arduino IDE, such as a serial monitor to debug the Arduino sketch too.

### Programino IDE for Arduino

Programino Arduino IDE is an Arduino IDE alternative with several features. This Arduino IDE can be used with Arduino/Genuino boards or compatible microcontrollers. Programino supports C/C++ language. It adds support for other languages, such as HTML, Javascript, and several others.

It is fully Arduino compatible, and the main features include:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Function explorer
  * Code competition
  * Code folding
  * Hardware viewer

This last feature is very useful because you have a view on the hardware you are using so that you do not have to remember the pin number for example.

### embedXcode

This is a free Arduino IDE developed for Mac OS X. This IDE supports syntax highlighting, line numbering and so on. It is a template for XCode 5 and XCode 6. This IDE simplifies the Arduino sketch development using a smart environment that assists you during the development. This IDE can be used with several prototyping boards, such as Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, Adafruit, and board based on Atmel and Cortex. You can refer to its website to have more information. [embedXcode](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/EmbedXcode) has different versions and licenses. There is a free version that supports the basic features, while if you want to unlock all its features, you should consider embedXcode+ that requires a license.

### Ktechlab

[KTechLab](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ktechlab/) is an IDE for microcontrollers. This is more than a simple IDE because it supports circuit simulation and can simulate the microcontroller and its circuit. It is able to simulate linear and non-linear devices. Moreover, this IDE can visualize the voltage and current flowing in the circuit. This platform is open source, and you can download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/ktechlab/ktechlab). It runs on Linux and Windows.

### Codebender

[Codebender](https://codebender.cc/) is a cloud Arduino IDE. It works online and you do not need to install the application locally. It is a web-based Arduino IDE that provides all the features you would expect from an IDE. It uses a cloud-compiler to convert the source code and upload it in Arduino. It is an open source platform, and its code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/codebendercc/). The Arduino IDE supports code highlighting and many other features. Moreover, your Arduino code is in the cloud so you can use and access it everywhere. It supports several boards, and if you do not find your board, you can upload your board definition. This feature makes this platform very versatile. Moreover, it has an important feature -- the capability to use Arduino code written by others on your board. This helps you to improve your knowledge.

This is a plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio. [This Arduino IDE ](https://www.visualmicro.com/)is fully compatible with Arduino. This IDE helps you to write Arduino code easily and fast with syntax highlighting, code error hints, and so on. It supports several Arduino boards, so you are free to select your board to write the code. It is very easy to use because it exploits the Visual Studio features, so you have an integrated environment where you can write the Arduino code. It supports Serial debug, and it is possible to create charts. Another interesting feature is the capability to use Arduino libraries. Visual Micro Arduino IDE fully supports the Arduino library format, and you can add it to your Arduino code easily using the Library manager.

### Zeus IDE
