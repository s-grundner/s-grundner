> _View the Airport Information Webservice endpoint WSDL._

6\. In the Airport Information Webservice Detail page, copy the link specified for the Endpoint.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6693993-capture17.png)

> _7. In a new tab in the web browser, navigate to the endpoint URL._

8\. Locate the operations and HTTP methods supported by the web service.

> _Make a call to retrieve data from an Airport Information Webservice operation._

9\. Go back to the Airport Information Webservice Detail page.

10\. In the list of operations under Demo, click getAirportInformationByAirportCode.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694035-capture19.png)

> _11. In the Test parameter dialog box, type the airportCode parameter value as LHR._

12\. Click Invoke.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694043-capture19.png)

13\. Verify that a new tab opens that displays the response received from the SOAP web service  
operation.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694054-capture20.png)

> _14. Copy the content after the horizontal line in the response web page._

15\. Return to the course snippets.txt file and copy the URL for the Web Toolkit Online:  
http://www.webtoolkitonline.com/xml-formatter.html.

16\. In a new tab in the web browser, navigate to that URL.

17\. Paste the content in the XML Content area.

18\. Click "format."

### Make a Call to an RPC API

You will examine the Slack RPC API and make a call to an RPC endpoint.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694098-capture21.png)

Examine the Slack Web API:  
1\. In a web browser, navigate to https://api.slack.com/web. Note: This URL is also located in the course snippets.txt file.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694104-capture22.png)

> _2. Click the HTTP RPC style methods link in the middle of the page._

3\. Scroll down to the list of methods that describe the actions that can be performed with the  
channels.

4\. Click the channels.list method.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694110-capture23.png)

5\. View the documentation for the channels.list method with the arguments and response  
information.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694130-capture24.png)

Make a call to an endpoint.

6\. Scroll back up and click the Tester tab.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6694150-capture25.png)

7\. In the Tester, select the No token or Invalid token option for the token attribute and click the  
Test Method button.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6695826-capture26.png)

8\. Verify that you see the response as not authorized or invalid authorization.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6695828-capture27.png)

Note: To obtain a valid token, you need a Slack account and to belong to an organization with  
channels and members. If you do have an account, you can generate tokens by following the  
information in the link below the token attribute value in the tester.

### Make a Call to a REST API

Here, you will explore a REST API. You will:

  1. Examine the Vimeo REST API.

  2. Make a call to a REST API endpoint to retrieve information.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6695831-capture28.png)

> _Examine the Vimeo REST API._

1\. In a web browser, navigate to https://developer.vimeo.com/api.

Note: This URL is also located in the course snippets.txt file.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6695840-capture29.png)

> _2. In the left navigation bar, click Playground._

3\. On the API/Playground page, click (Emptyâ€¦) on the left-hand side.

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/6695850-capture30.png)

> _4. In the expanded list of resources, click categories._

5\. Click the Make Call button.

6\. Verify the response has a status code 200.

7\. Scroll the page and view the data for the Animation and Arts & Design categories.

### Translating Functional Requirements for APIs

**Objectives:**

  * Identify the different categories and actions for REST APIs.

  * Convert categories to resources.

  * Select HTTP methods to support the actions on categories.

  * List the categories and actions for an API.

In this walkthrough, you list out the functional requirements for an API. You will:

  * Identify the categories for a REST API.

  * Define actions for the categories to decide how users will consume the API.

List categories:

1\. Create User functionality text file, add the following categories:

  * CUSTOMERS

  * ACCOUNTS

  * TRANSACTIONS

List detailed actions:

2\. In the User functionality text file, add a detailed list of actions that developers should be  
able to perform with the API for each of the categories.

CUSTOMERS -

  1. Get a list of all customers in the bank.

  2. Get customer information for a specific customer ID.

  3. Register a new customer.

  4. Update customer information for a specific customer ID.

  5. Delete a customer with a specific customer ID.

ACCOUNTS -

  1. Get a list of all accounts for a specific customer ID.

  2. Get account information for a specific account ID.

  3. Create a new account.

  4. Update account information for a specific account ID.

  5. Delete an account with a specific account ID.

TRANSACTIONS -

  1. Get transactions for a specific account ID.

  2. Get transaction information for a specific transaction ID.

  3. Create a new transaction.
