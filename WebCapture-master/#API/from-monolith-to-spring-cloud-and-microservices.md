Premier develops SaaS solutions that help healthcare organizations provide higher quality and safer care to patients, lower costs, improve the satisfaction of patients and their families, and that stay current with changes in care delivery. Premier is in a constant state of evolving their solutions and associated technology stack to stay current with modern web app architectural patterns.

In this session, they will discuss the following:

  * Their historical monolithic architectural patterns, building applications for JBoss with server-side rendering.

  * Their experiences and lessons learned moving to Spring MVC single-page apps.

  * Their decision to move to a microservices-oriented architecture and how they leveraged Spring Boot to get there.

  * How they use Netflix OSS/Spring Cloud to handle the new complexities of a microservices architecture.

  * Using Spring Cloud Config Server to drive application configuration and a metadata-driven user interface.

  * Implementing Eureka for service registry/discovery.

  * Securing and automating deployments for a Spring Cloud infrastructure with Bamboo.

  * Overall lessons learned in our evolution to a Spring Cloud microservice oriented architecture.
