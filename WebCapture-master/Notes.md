* “Any repetitive process that you perform is a candidate for automation. Anything that you do more than once, you can automate.”

* “We want to understand the value of what our stakeholders care about first, and then reverse engineer that to the activities we perform in our marketing operations teams.”

* "This mechanism is known as a pull system because new work is pulled into the system when there is capacity to handle it, rather than being pushed into the system based on demand."

* Scrum events aren't meetings, but opportunities for a conversation. Tobias Mayer describes this perfectly in his book The People's Scrum:

> “Scrum is centered on people, and people have conversations. There are conversations to plan, align, and to reflect. We have these conversations at the appropriate times, and for the appropriate durations in order to inform our work. If we don't have these conversations, we won't know what we are doing (planning), we won't know where we are going (alignment), and we'll keep repeating the same mistakes (reflection).”

* Einstellung (in der meist englischen Fachliteratur attitude) bezeichnet in der Psychologie die aus der Erfahrung kommende Bereitschaft (Prädisposition) eines Individuums, in bestimmter Weise auf eine Person, eine soziale Gruppe, ein Objekt, eine Situation oder eine Vorstellung wertend zu reagieren, was sich im kognitiven (Annahmen und Überzeugungen), affektiven (Gefühle und Emotionen) und behavioralen (Verhaltensweisen) Bereich ausdrücken kann. Beispiele für Einstellungen sind Vorurteile, Sympathie und Antipathie oder der Selbstwert. Einstellungen haben die Funktion, Objekte einzuschätzen sowie durch Identifikation und Distanzierung zu Individuen soziale Anpassung zu erreichen.

* Die Einstellungsforschung klärt die Zusammenhänge von Einstellungen, Verhalten und Handeln. Sie fragt vor allem danach, unter welchen Bedingungen Einstellungen zustande kommen, wie dauerhaft diese sind und unter welchen Bedingungen sie geändert werden.

* „Failure is the consequence of doing something new. In biz failure is used as bludgeon to attack people.“

* So what’s the missing link? Requirements. The code may be of the highest quality, but if it’s not reflecting what was specified in the requirements, you may have built perfectly useless code.

> Louis Srygley has an apt description for this: “Without requirements and design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.”
The key is to change our mindset of using “testing” as the only means to achieve application quality.
Martin Thompson says it best: “It took us centuries to reach our current capabilities in civil engineering, so we should not be surprised by our current struggles with software.”
“If we look to other engineering [disciplines], we can see the use of tooling to support the process of delivery rather than imposing a process on it.”
As teams adjust to Agile software development practices, they become better at calculating their capacity and estimating the size of tasks. Consequently, their predictability increases, and they begin to deliver consistently on the content that they commit to producing.

* The Scrum Guide starts defining a Sprint with this sentence:

>  “The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a ‘Done’, usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.”
At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.” It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it. —  Scrum Guide

* I see four main reasons to automate a computer-related task:

> - Speed. This is the obvious one that everyone thinks of. We’ll come back to it later.
- Consistency and accuracy. Little errors often creep in when you do a repetitive task by hand.
- Conservation of concentration. Multistep tasks can take your mind off of what you’re working on. I owe this insight to John D. Cook.
- Entertainment and satisfaction. Puzzling out an automation script is way more fun than Sudoku.

* At its core, Agile is a set of Values and Principles:

> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
Underlying these is a mindset with a focus on self-discipline, self-organization, and adaption to change.

> A short explanation about the ~ part:
(If you've used a Unix shell before, you probably know this part already) ~ means "the user's home directory". That's where on most systems you have folders like "Documents", "Downloads", "Desktop", "Music", etc.
On iOS, you don't have a "home directory", because every app runs in its own sandbox. So on iOS, the "home directory" is the app's user data folder, which is the /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/{UUID} folder that you see in many paths.
Unlike a shell, Python doesn't automatically understand the ~ shortcut. You need to manually use os.path.expanduser(path) to replace the ~ with the actual home directory path.
Long story short, to move your module files to the correct location, this command should work:
`shutil.move(os.path.expanduser("~/Library/Application Support/Commands/site-packages/gspread"), os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/site-packages/gspread"))`

> One of the reasons teams fail to build product discovery into their work is a hyper-focus and management to drive velocity of delivery /1
Adding in discovery work increases a different type of velocity -- the velocity of learning /2
However, there isn't a different bucket of capacity for the team for each type of work (discovery vs delivery) /3
This means that as the team increases their velocity of learning (discovery work) the velocity of delivery goes down. /4
This is OK since it informs the team on which delivery work makes most sense right now. But most teams struggle to absorb this "slowdown" /5
Successful lean/agile teams find the right balance b/w velocity of delivery and velocity of learning. /6 <fin>
