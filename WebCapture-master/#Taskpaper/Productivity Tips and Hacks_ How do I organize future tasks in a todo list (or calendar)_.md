Rather than looking for a new app I think you should look for a **Time Management methodology** that works for you.

There are many books on the subject, one of the first successful was _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People). Also check out_ First Things First_: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_\(book\)) written by the same author, tries to take the whole thing a step further by introducing the importance/urgence matrix:

A very enjoyable (and long!) lecture by Randy Pausch may help you understanding without actually reading the book:

Another very successful method is explained in [Getting Things Done (system)](https://www.quora.com/topic/Getting-Things-Done-system), a book so relevant that its name is used to define a whole category (as you can see from Amir's comment). I think it's more suited for long-term plans and tries to look at time management from a different point of view: not focused on priority but rather on freeing your mind and organizing your tasks in different lists.

Personally I don't use any of the above-mentioned, because _"A smarter way to work and live®"_ on David Allen's website makes me shiver (in a bad way) especially with the ® sign.  
What I can suggest from my experience is:

  * Divide large tasks in smaller ones
  * Try to say no more often or delegate tasks to someone else
  * Establish deadlines
