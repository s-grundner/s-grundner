# Abstractspoon TodoList Semi-Mobile

_Captured: 2015-06-12 at 00:04 from [www.movingelectrons.net](http://www.movingelectrons.net/blog/2013/12/02/todolist.html)_

I'll start by saying that [ToDoList](http://www.abstractspoon.com/) is **the best** project management software for windows. Calling it a Todolist application is an understatement. I have tried literally dozens of Todolist and project management applications for windows, both web based and standalone, including offline/mobile combos, and none comes close to the versatility, advanced features and performance that this application offers.

However, there is a big downside: there is no mobile version. I contacted the developer and there are currently no plans for either a mobile application or for including syncing capabilities. He recommended an iOS app developed by a third party, but unfortunately it is not very useful at his point. Apparently there are plans to allow syncing with [Toodledo](http://www.toodledo.com/), but I'm not sure if all the application features will be replicated.

Therefore, I decided to implement some **limited mobile capabilities** myself. My main objective is being able to access my _overdue tasks, tasks currently due and tasks due in the near future (7 days)_. I put together a python [script](https://gist.github.com/Moving-Electrons/7762481) that does exactly that. It also includes both the _Category_ and _Priority_ assigned to each task. For tasks due within the next 7 days, it includes the _Due Date_ at the end of the line. The output is formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so it can be easily rendered by iOS Apps like Editorial or Nebulous Notes.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/Moving-Electrons/7762481) is the code in GitHub. This script runs in a Linux machine and the output file is placed in a folder in [Dropbox](https://db.tt/LdFyqgz2), so that it can be accessed from my iPhone or iPad. A Cron job runs the script every 15 minutes.

Here is an example of the output as seen rendered by the **Editorial App** for iPad (sorry, I had to blur some proprietary work information).

Several posts can be written and have been written about **Editorial**, so I won't reinvent the wheel. [Here](http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/) is one of my favorites reviews from [Macstories](http://www.macstories.net). You can also view and download the application from the widget below.

Editorial is a plain text editor for the iPad with powerful automation tools and a beautiful inline preview for writing Markdown. You can combine a large selection of simple text processing actions into your very own workflows -- all in an intuitive drag'n'drop interface that makes it easy to see what's happening. Features: * Inline Markdown Preview - You can always swipe left to switch to a full HTML preview. * Extensible with Workflows - More than 50 configurable actions can be combined into powerful workflows for extending Editorial's feature set. * Scriptable with Python - You can also integrate scripts into your workflows for even more advanced automation. * Sync with Dropbox - You can store your documents in a configurable Dropbox folder, and even view comparisons with older versions to see the progress you've made. * Smart Keyboard - The extended keyboard was specifically designed for writing Markdown and includes all the special characters you need. * Snippets - Quickly insert frequently-used pieces of text by typing abbreviations. Snippets can include dynamic text like the current date or clipboard contents. TextExpanderâ„¢ snippets are also supported. * In-App Browser - If you need to do some quick research while writing, you don't have to leave the app for that. * Full Documentation - Editorial comes with a complete set of documentation for all the different workflow actions and Python modules. Help is directly accessible from the workflow and Python editors. *** *** *** "It would be hard to imagine a better editor, let alone recommend one that actually exists." -- The Verge "This is it. Editorial sets a new standard for third-party iOS automation, and, for me, there's no going back." -- Federico Viticci, MacStories "Editorial just reinvented iOS text editing." -- Merlin Mann
