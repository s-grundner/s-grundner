**As technology originally offered only in premium segments becomes widespread, the so-called human-machine interface will become a car's trademark.**

At its most basic, HMI involves anything happening on the dashboard of a car and the way the control switches feel or move, or even the way a knob or switch sounds when it is used - if it even makes a sound. Those myriad small things "may seem arcane, but they are very important to the consumer," says Ian Beavis, chief strategy officer at consultancy AMCI.

In this area, interior designers will become the rock stars of HMI, he says. Automakers must have a well-defined understanding of their brand and ensure the flow of the controls in a car reflects that brand, Beavis says.

Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner, argues interior designers will be only players in the rock band where HMI branding is concerned.

HMI "is truly one of the converged areas where design has to collaborate with technology and engineering and IT," he says. "The car could become cooler than any of the digital devices out there."

He mentions Volvo's Concept 26 as an example of an automaker starting to realize the HMI branding possibilities.

Concept 26, which Volvo introduced at the Los Angeles auto show, is a three-mode autonomous driving system that allows the driver to decide how much he or she wants to control the drive versus letting the car take over. It is an area where automakers can truly innovate, Koslowski says.

[Delphi](http://wardsauto.com/taxonomy/term/53697?intlink=incontent) also sees HMI as an area where automakers can innovate. The discussion these days is about how the user experience in connected cars can be made safer, says Kathy Winter, vice president-software and services business MyFi advanced engineering at Delphi Electronics and Safety.

"There are almost endless ways you can talk to your car in a safer way," including gesture, voice control and touch, Winter tells _WardsAuto_.

Cars will have safety features that are continuously updated over the air the way mobile phones are now, she says. That will allow a vehicle to know, for example, when a driver is entering a construction zone. The car will turn down the volume of an infotainment system so the driver more closely concentrates on the road.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, [Delphi](http://wardsauto.com/taxonomy/term/53697?intlink=incontent) will showcase next-generation user experiences for the whole vehicle. They will envision "how you can potentially interact not just with your infotainment systems but the entire vehicle itself as we move forward into automated driving," Winter says.
