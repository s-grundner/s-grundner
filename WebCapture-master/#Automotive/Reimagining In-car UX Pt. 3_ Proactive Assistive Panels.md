_This third and final article is a part of the in-car UX exploration series that I have been writing about._

_In the first part of this series, I aimed at _**_[reimagining the instrument cluster_**](https://uxdesign.cc/re-imagining-instrument-clusters-in-cars-be0bb4afd5b6#.hryv7d1b0)_ of automobiles by specifically trying to tackle the problem of distraction while driving -- my idea was to have nifty controls that helped drivers achieve simple tasks without having to take their hands off the wheel._

_With more exploration, research, and talking to people who are rather new to driving, I uncovered some major insights that led me to design_**_[ for driver anxiety_**](https://uxdesign.cc/reimagining-in-car-ux-pt-2-designing-for-anxiety-2dfead1c45dd#.ssq4fckb4)_ in the second part of the series._

In my third and final part, I aim to conglomerate my concepts from the first part (after iterating based on feedback from multiple drivers), and research and findings from the second part to create a proactive system for automobiles.

### What is a proactive system?

This concept of a proactive system is not new but is rather ubiquitous in almost all the apps we use. Google Now (now known as Google Assistant) presents us with quick pieces of relevant and contextual information based on time of the day, location and news. iOS automatically gives you a shortcut to open your music application as you plug a headphone in. I wanted to extend this concept of a proactive system to the automotive sector -- driving requires quite a bit of conscious attention and reducing that cognitive load through intelligent systems would definitely benefit drivers.

Below is a short clip which is a proof-of-concept that explains how I envision proactive systems to function --

This Proactive Assistive Panel helps mitigate anxiety by keeping the drivers informed about the situations and providing contextual help. The controls on the steering wheel help drivers to keep the focus on the road and do not require them to take the hands o the wheel which could potentially be dangerous. The parking assistance can be triggered either by the system or could be triggered by the driver. It helps in finding parking around an area which makes it easier for drivers to navigate around a new area and park.

The system does not require complete voice control which through research has been proved to be extremely risky. It requires only _binary_ input from the user as the system prompts with actions that it could perform based on the context or scenario while driving. This greatly reduces the cognitive load of the driver to take decisions. Imagine not having to say "Hey Siri" or "Ok Google" and wait for a response only to realize that the voice recognition had detected wrong words.

From talking to drivers and noticing people perform multiple tasks while driving, I noticed that most systems these days have complex interactions with very little room for error. The touch targets are either too narrow to accurately press or consists of multiple convoluted steps to achieve even a trivial action. I wanted to keep the interactions as simple as possible and make the driver think as little as possible -- hence the idea of a conversational interaction that requires only binary input from the driver.

Driving is a complex activity and taking context into consideration is primal to a successful in-car experience. Google Now has cards that can identify where the car has been parked -- this is a very nifty tool especially when one parks their car in a big parking lot. Finding parking when you reach a destination, routing via roads with minimal traffic etc takes context into account in addition to learning your driving behavior over time.

Completely self-driving cars are here, and it only a matter of time before they pervade roads. The whole definition of context changes once the cars start driving themselves -- there would be a great opportunity to design for entertainment or even making the car a modular workplace during longer commutes. Having said that, car consoles/clusters still are very poorly designed. A huge gap needs to be bridged in how the current consoles work before self-driving cars take over.
