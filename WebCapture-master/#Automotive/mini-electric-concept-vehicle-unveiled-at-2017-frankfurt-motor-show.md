**the powerful drive of the [MINI](https://www.mini.de/de_DE/home.html) electric concept draws its energy from a lithium-ion battery, ensuring maximum range and typical MINI agility combined with emission-free mobility. **since the electric motor does not require cooling air, the hexagonal front grille is closed in order to enhance the car's aerodynamic properties. there are also fibre glass attachment parts that reduce aerodynamic drag. the paint finish in reflection silver and interchange yellow is reminiscent of the MINI E presented in 2008.

_'the MINI electric concept is a quintessential MINI - compact, agile, simply the ideal companion for everyday driving. at the same time, it conveys a whole new take on the concept of sportiness,'_** explains adrian van hooydonk, senior vice president BMW group design.** _'indeed, aerodynamics and lightweight design aren't just important in the world of motor sport; they are also essential factors for maximising electric range. the car's surfaces have a sense of precision and contemporary clarity about them that lends added impact to the car's efficient character. plus, striking accents and vivid contrasts give the exterior that distinctive MINI twist.'_
