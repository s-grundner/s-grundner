There's been quite the arms race for driverless cars, with [many companies declaring that their technology will hit markets by 2020.](http://www.techinsider.io/google-apple-tesla-race-to-develop-self-driving-cars-by-2020-2015-10)

But a recent [report released by Juniper Research](http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/self-driving-cars-to-take-off-by-2021-approaching?utm_source=juniperpr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Autonomous_Vehicles_15_PR1), a mobile and digital market research firm, has listed the top five players that are most likely to bring self-driving cars to consumers.

The automakers were scored on the follow categories: time spent developing related technologies; first live test and other trials conducted; the number of miles tested on public roads; the size of the fleet; media coverage; employees working on autonomous projects; and future opportunities.

Some companies that were selected based on those factors were then interviewed by Juniper's research team to finalize the ranking, a Juniper Research spokesperson told Tech Insider.

Here's a look at the top five players, according to the report.
