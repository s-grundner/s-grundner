Cars have long been associated with extravagance since their inception. Conversely, major accidents have also arisen due to several human errors in driving cars. Efforts have been made to introduce safety airbags and enhanced accessories for security. Still, major impacts haven't been seen when it comes to stopping a drastic error manually.

## **Automated Cars, Are They a Dream?**

Flashback to your favorite sci-fi movies -- we get a hold of self-driving automatic cars. However, one question always remains: is it possible to do so? Thanks to Tesla, a multinational corporation based in Palo Alto, California, that specializes in electric vehicles, these automatically controlled cars are no longer a fantasy. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, profoundly hopes to manufacture certain vehicles that would be self-driven within a decade, terming them as being as common as the elevators being used today!

**Technology market research reports** claim that the advanced technology that would be used to make this happen is accounting to recast as well as agitate the transportation and vehicle industry in the future.

Furthermore, industry experts in** market research reports** say that the technology is going to disrupt or revolutionize the future of transportation as we know it.

## **How Has it Been on a Large Scale?**

Globally, almost 90 percent of accidents are caused due to human errors. According to Stanford Law School, road injury has been the eighth-most leading cause of deaths in the world. Accordingly to the World Health Organization, road accidents have been assessed as the major cause of casualties just behind diabetes.

Men have reported being injured or killed more often than women, with an account of incidents based on the age group of 15 to 29 years (now we see maturity does come up with age!). Additionally, road traffic accidents have an estimated killing of over 1.4 million people across the worldwide scale in a subsequent year.

Insurance companies make a profit by charging customers based on their driving history. The better you have been driving with careful procedures, the less you have to pay. Consequently, a young male in his early twenties with a high risk of accident history would be charged with a higher premium.

This serves the entry of automated self-driving cars. With no one behind the wheel, there's only a single premium surrounding the vehicle.

## **The Technology Behind the Wheels!**

The overall technology surrounding automated technologies have been previously adapted in airlines. We all have been quite familiar with the term "autopilot," which derives its origin from airlines. Additionally, auto landing and self-monitoring have been also credited with being an advanced technology. The only difference being the process has been fairly different in terms of airplanes, as the traffic above isn't as heavily occupied as regular traffic on the road. Conversely, this has been pretty well depicted in the so-called sci-fi movies. Perhaps, these movies will no longer be just a fantasy but, instead, a reality.
