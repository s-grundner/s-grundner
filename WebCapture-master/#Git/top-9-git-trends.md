Ever wonder how you stack up against other Git developers in the industry? Do you sometimes get the sense that you're somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to Git knowledge and experience? We surveyed developers to find answers to these questions, and to discover other Git trends!

## Top 9 Git Trends:

### 1\. Well, look at that! Two-thirds of developers consider themselves intermediate Git users.

While the other 21% consider themselves beginners and 13% advanced.

### 2\. Two-thirds of developers use a combination of the CLI and a Git GUI.

22% use a GUI only and 11% use the CLI only. _*Cough, cough*_ GitKraken is a great [Git GUI](https://www.gitkraken.com/) if you don't want to use the CLI exclusively.
