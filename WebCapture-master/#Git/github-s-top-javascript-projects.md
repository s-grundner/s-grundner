[JavaScript](https://dashbouquet.com/blog/web-development/top-10-most-popular-javascript-projects-on-github) was originally known only for developing the client side of web pages, and as new frameworks have been developed for server-side purposes, it is no surprise that JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.

With the increase in the number of programmers learning to code in JavaScript, the development of great projects has been on the rise as well.

## **1\. React.js**

**88,356 ★**

JavaScript is known mainly for client-side projects and [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) is an example of a framework for developing great front-end designs and interactions. Created by Facebook, React is a library that is used for creating powerful reusable UI components.

One of the positives of using React is that it hides away complexity by using a virtual DOM which helps improve applications' performance. Features of React include the JavaScript syntax extension, unidirectional data flow, components, and much more.

Learning React is pretty easy if you have a good grasp of JavaScript. You can access the tutorial from the [React.js website](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Installation and setup of React is pretty easy.

`npm install -g create-react-app`

`create-react-app my-app`

`cd my-app`

`npm start`

## **2\. Vue.js**

**83, 742 ★**

Just like React, [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) is another framework for building lovely user interfaces. This progressive framework is designed to be easily adaptable as time passes, this makes the library easy to integrate with other projects and use anytime.

Vue.js is known widely for its simplicity and, besides that, it is lightweight, well documented, and allows for flexibility during development. Vue encourages developers to write "simple JavaScript," therefore, it is easy for beginners to pick up.

Looking for a guide? [Here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is one from the developers themselves. Vue is pretty easy to install and setup.

`_npm install -g vue-cli_`

`_vue init webpack my-app_`

`_cd my-app_`

`_npm install_`

`_npm run dev_`

## **3\. Node.js**

**45, 478 ★**

Here is one of the best ever frameworks for server-side development, and the which gave JavaScript its popularity with server-side scripting projects.

[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) has brought about the package management tool NPM which has helped make life easier for lots of developers. Developers also love that it provides a non-blocking I/O model, can be used to develop real-time web applications, is easy to learn, and has a large community.

The installation process for Node is different on Windows and Linux. For Windows, a simple download and install of the Node.js [executable application ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)would suffice.

For Linux, the following Linux terminal command would get it installed:

`sudo apt-get update `

`sudo apt-get install nodejs`

After installation, the following command should be run to confirm a successful installation.

`node -v`

## **4\. Atom**

#### **43, 368 ★**

Here is one of the best text editors you will ever find. It competes with the likes of Sublime Text and Visual Studio as it is feature-heavy and comes with a smart autocomplete, an integrated spell-check, and is quite easy to use.

It is, however, pretty difficult to get started with using [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), this is because of the time it takes to setup the plugins that help make for a great experience.

Installing Atom on Linux is not so difficult, running the command below would do the job.

`curl -L https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -`

`sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list'`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install atom`

Installing this on Windows is not difficult either, the executable file can be downloaded from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases).

**36, 624 ★**

Earlier in the article, we talked about the Node.js framework. Express was actually built upon Node.js!

[Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) is a flexible Node.js-based web application framework used for developing quality web and mobile applications.

Used for building web applications and APIs, Express.js has become very popular in the JavaScript community. If you have been in the business for a while, you most likely would have heard of the MEAN stack - Express makes up the backend part of that stack.

Express makes the development process faster, it's easy to configure and customize, can be integrated with a ton of template engines, and doesn't make a connection to databases a hassle.

Since Express is built on Node.js, it can be installed using the NPM tool.

`npm init`

Then to install and add Express to the list of dependencies:

`npm install express --save`

Or to install without adding Express to the list of dependencies:

`npm install express --no-save`

## **9\. Chart.js**

`npm install chart.js --save`

## **10\. Yarn**

![Image title](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/8229326-yarn.png)

**30, 168 ★**

This is a JavaScript package management tool that helps make the development process easier.

Just like React, [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) was developed by Facebook and could be considered an improvement on the NPM tool as it parallelizes operations which npm doesn't and makes more efficient use of the network.

Some of the reasons for Yarn's popularity is its speed in execution, robust working system, availability of license checks and its incredible compatibility with the NPM and Bower package management tools.

Yarn can be installed using the npm tool:

`npm install yarn --global`

On Linux, it can also be installed using the command below:

`curl - sS https: //dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add - `

`echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee / etc / apt _/ sources.list.d / yarn.list_`

Then:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn`

It is important to note that the projects discussed in this article have gained a lot of popularity in the last year, however, this may not necessarily mean that they are the best solutions in all situations for the problems they are used to solve.
