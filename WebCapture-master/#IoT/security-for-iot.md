From remotely checking in on a smart factory, to conveniently working from home, to relaxing in a driverless car, the Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for many exciting new opportunities. For businesses, IoT means new enterprises, new business models and new revenue streams. But the inherent nature of IoT - connecting 'things' to each other and to the cloud to form a network - gives rise to a host of new security threats. That's why the right security must be an integral part of each IoT design.

## The right security - the basis for IoT

Equipping smart devices, connected cars, companies and Industry 4.0 factories with the right security solutions from the get-go is key to helping prevent attacks - whether theft, fraud or manipulation. The right security helps to protect a company's IP and data, and to maintain customer confidence in its brand and products. Further, the right security solutions for IoT can help a company:

  * Enable new business models
  * Differentiate and grow
  * Save costs

## Why hardware security is a must

Companies who are looking for a security solution need one that is equally easy to use - in terms of fast integration and time to market - and trustworthy. Unlike software-only solutions a hardware-based solution is strong, tamperproof and provides a solid foundation. In addition InfineonÂ´s independently-certified hardware security solutions are pre-integrated and therefore easy to integrate into your system.
