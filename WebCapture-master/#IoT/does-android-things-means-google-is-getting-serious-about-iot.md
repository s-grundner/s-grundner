The Internet of Things could be right over the horizon if the latest updates from Google's latest developer conference are to be taken seriously. In years past, Google I/O was promoted as the place where you could get all the cutting-edge tech that the Internet giant was working on firsthand. Recently, however, the conference hasn't made much of a splash regarding world-changing updates. Until now, that is. Google's announcement of the release of Android Things 1.0 is a step towards making the Internet of Things a reality, and one that has been anticipated ever since the IoT was conceptualized.

## A New Iteration

While Android Things, to the layman, may seem as though it's Google's first strides into anything to deal with IoT, Google has actually been to this rodeo before. Google is responsible for a pair of protocols called Thread (a joint project with hardware manufacturers such as Qualcomm and ARM) and Weave -- a media player designed specifically for Thread. According to [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-android-things-gary-explains-740572/), Google Things is a continuation and further development of a project which Google has termed "Brillo," which was initially distributed in 2015. Google, known for pushing the boundaries of its own technology, has made the first step towards complete interconnectedness. Even so, Android Things in its current state has this almost-but-not-quite-there-yet feel.

## Application Architecture

In its current iteration, Android Things seems more focused on the consumer instead of as a serious developer-centric project. However, Google intends to change this with a series of lectures and discussions at Google I/O aimed at bringing the people who are going to be using the technology the most up to date with what it's offering. The signal this sends to the programming world is that Google is invested in seeing the IoT become a reality. Android Things sets the stage for a complete change in the paradigm of Smart Devices and their interconnection and interaction.

## What's the Big Deal?

We already have access to Smart Devices that have managed to make our lives a whole lot easier. With the latest iteration of these devices such as Alexa and Siri, we've learned how to use them to automate the mundane aspects of our lives. The reason why the IoT is an exciting development is that we can see the development of applications built around making life easy for the individual. It encourages the [development of services](https://hbr.org/2013/05/how-the-internet-of-things-cha) that can be used with smart devices that enable the user to do a lot more, even have their data shared between multiple devices in order to streamline how those devices interact with the user. The IoT will fuel customizability in our devices at a level that has never existed in managed IT services prior to now. It represents the next logical step in the evolution of labor-saving devices. Google's development of Android Things also addresses a very serious pre-existing situation regarding the security of information on public Smart Devices, a solution that could push development forward in leaps and bounds.

## Securing the IoT

Security concerns remain the biggest stumbling block for the implementation of a proper IoT. Hardware manufacturers have been notoriously slow in getting updates out to clients meaning that exploits have time to spread and be used before being patched out. With something as widespread as the IoT, this is a serious issue and must be dealt with. Android Things is a step towards aiding that since Google itself can send updates to its devices without using the manufacturer as a go-between, vastly speeding up the time it takes to roll out patches.

## The Future is Coming

While Android Things is the first step, it's a long road to where everything is connected. The exciting part of it is how much promise it offers for enterprise or industrial developers looking to take advantage of Google's existing framework. This stable release tells us that Google isn't mucking around when it comes to making the IoT a reality. Every great journey does, after all, start with the first step.
