_Captured: 2017-12-15 at 12:58 from [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/alltheiot-protocols)_

I'd like to welcome you to the second episode of our new series of videos and guides, designed to help you learn about and make your very own connected objects

This is Adafruit and Digikey's **ALL THE INTERNET OF THINGS** \- a six-part series, covering everything you need to know about the Internet of Things (which we will shorten to **IoT**).

For our second guide, we'll go over the most popular _protocols _used in the IoT industry, as well as the upsides and downsides of each type of protocol to help you decide what you'll use to connect your devices to the internet and exchange data

[In TRANSPORTS we talked about - "How to Get From Your Device to the Internet" \- POWER, DISTANCE, AND BITS.](https://learn.adafruit.com/../../../../alltheiot-transports)

Transports are the _physical_ and _wireless_ means to get the data around - how to get from _here_ to _there _and back again. But transports often are not structured - your data shows up in a pile of bits. You may not get your data in order, correctly or even at all!

On top of the transport layer, we can add another level of quality assurance -** PROTOCOL**! A protocol can be thought of as the language each machine, or machines, use to talk to each other. Protocols don't deal with the messy business of moving bits to and from, they are a higher level set of rules the machines use to talk to each other.
