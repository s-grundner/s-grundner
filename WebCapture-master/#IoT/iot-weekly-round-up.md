It's been a little turbulent for all things internet and IoT-related this week. Fake feedback comments may delay the net neutrality vote, Volocopter aims to launch its flying taxis by 2020, and there's a new service to help predict an impending Bitcoin crash. Read on for the latest from the connected world.

## Bitcoin Bubble Burst Warns You of a Coming Crash

Bitcoin believers and skeptics alike may benefit from [Bitcoin Bubble Burst](https://bitcoinbubbleburst.github.io/#overview). It's a service that alerts you in real-time to factors that might precipitate the crash everyone seems to be expecting. Bitcoin Bubble Burst's machine learning system is trained to spot potential crisis points and give you a chance to sell before the panic truly sets in. It keeps watch for relevant news stories and major shifts in Bitcoin price then passes on the information as a kind of digest. Future plans include the ability for users to set their own risk thresholds, determining how often they receive alerts.

## Ionic, the Fitbit Smartwatch, to Incorporate 60 New Apps

Fitbit is adding 60 new apps to its Ionic smartwatch, [according to a blog article](https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-os-update/) posted on Tuesday. The apps include Yelp, Uber, Nest, and TripAdvisor, with music service Deezer to join next year. You can expect 100 new watch faces to choose from, too.

## Flying Taxis Are Only Two or Three Years Away, Says Volocoper

Volocoper, a German-based company, expects to provide flying taxis in just two or three years. [Speaking at TechCrunch's Disrupt event in Berlin](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/volocopter-expect-our-flying-taxis-running-for-real-in-two-to-three-years/), CIO and co-founder Alex Zosel said that the first commercial applications could be up and running by 2020. It's likely the service will start life as a solution to ease traffic congestion in built-up areas, and develop into a shuttle service later down the line.

## IBM's POWER9 Chip Is Built for AI

IBM has a new chip in town: [POWER9](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/us-en/resources/power/enterprise-ai/). The POWER9 processor has four times the bandwidth of its predecessor and is built to handle intensive AI and machine learning workloads. Its state-of-the-art I/O subsystem technology includes next-generation NVIDIA NVLink, PCle Gen4, and OpenCAPI: interfaces that will give data scientists more accurate insights more quickly than ever before. There's also a new server offering AI processing speeds of up to 300 petaflops: the IBM Power Systems AC922.

## New York Attorney General Calls for Delay on Net Neutrality Vote

A couple of weeks ago, we wrote about Ajit Pai's [controversial plan to scrap current net neutrality rules](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/iot-weekly-round-up-23rd-november-2017/) \- a proposal that will be put to the vote on the 14th of December. The net neutrality feedback process prompted over 23 million comments, of which one million may be linked to stolen identities, according to the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. [Schneiderman has joined 27 senators in calling for a delay to the vote](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/schneiderman-delay-fcc-vote/), while the source of the fraudulent comments is investigated.
