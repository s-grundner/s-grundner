Every day I, like many others, receive a deluge of IoT topics in my Google Alerts feed. It's safe to say that if you haven't heard of the IoT you are probably living under a rock. Without a doubt, the Internet of Things is one of today's biggest conversation points in the tech world, and it is only getting more immense. IoT think tanks, panels, summits, and ideathons, are increasingly popping up [across the globe](http://www.iotevents.org/) from Bangalore to San Francisco to Berlin. It is [predicted](http://www.bofaml.com/en-us/content/harnessing-technology.html) that there will be 50 billion connected devices in this world by 2020. That's six connections per every living person on Earth! While some IoT ideas might seem more hypothetical at the moment, such as smart city trash bins and mosquito density sensing, other IoT concepts have already begun to gain substantial traction. Take for example IoT startups such as [Sproutling](http://www.sproutling.com/) (smart baby monitor) and [Switchmate](http://myswitchmate.com/) (smart light switch), that are already quickly selling out of their unique, innovative technologies. The ideas and possibilities are truly endless.

It's an exciting time to say the least. This vast revolution, nay, evolution of technology is sure to present unique opportunities and challenges for a variety of industries from automotive to healthcare. Businesses who are wanting to create an IoT device or are already in the beginning stages of development, will need to consider a myriad of factors from data storage and sensors, to extensive security measures. Yet with the majority of IoT devices relying on mobile applications as their user's home base, mobile app makers will also need to thoughtfully reassess how to optimize their app's UX, especially considering the expanded digital interface. The mobile app associated with a connected device will basically serve as the middle man between device and user. It will also communicate to your user the essential value/argument for adoption of your IoT device. IoT mobile apps would be doing a great disservice to themselves if they only consider the technical needs of their devices and are nonchalant regarding the app user experience. Want your IoT app to succeed? Make sure that the following app UX elements are prioritized and fully optimized.

# Connectivity

The underlying concept of the IoT is that all devices are "connected." Lack fundamental, strong connection, you automatically undermine the quality of your product and your user's experience. As Claire Rowland from UX Mag simply puts it, "It's frustrating when a web page is slow to download or a Skype call fails. But we accept that these irritations are just part of using the Internet. By contrast, real-world objects respond to us immediately and reliably." Now the IoT has the power to morph the innate nature of objects. Real-world objects have the potential to experience delays- thus increasing the potential for more intense frustration from users due to ingrained predispositions towards everyday objects.

Imagine your user encounters a surprise snowfall on their walk home and wants to turn on their home heating system via your connected app. They attempt to turn on the heater, yet there's a flawed connection and thus the heater does not turn on. This automatically sours your user's relationship with not only your app but your product altogether. Yes okay- your user would have been in the same situation if he was without an IoT heating device, yet your app and the device got your user's hopes up, and then let them down. That's the critical element. Basically, what were once considered "minor interruptions" when interacting with a web page, can be absolutely detrimental to the UX of your app and connected device. Due to the gravity of connection errors when it comes to IoT apps- especially in the case of apps that are used to monitor a living thing, home heating system, carbon monoxide levels etc.- make sure your QA team thoroughly tests and continues to test different connectivity scenarios.

# Clarity

Whether you have an IoT device for monitoring your baby or a system for tracking your [farm's health](https://www.farmx.co/), one element is absolutely necessary when it comes to your associated application- clarity of data. For an IoT device that acts to monitor and record, your application will serve as the essential communicator/interpreter of all the information it is gleaning. Fail to communicate this data clearly and completely (and even in some cases, compellingly), and your user will have no use for your app and thus your device. While it is essential to be comprehensive when communicating the data, if you overwhelm the user with too much information, you will add complication to the user's daily life and surely seal the fate of your application. Especially if your user is an average, everyday citizen, don't expect that they have a degree in statistics- communicate to them in a relatable, absorbable manner. Overall aim to have a smooth, coherent UI, clear visuals, and minimal text.

Let's take a look at Sproutling's baby monitoring device, which communicates its crucial data comprehensibly and appealingly. When it comes to tracking the well-being of its user's child, the last thing it wants to do is confuse its user and/or risk the safety of the child due to miscommunicated or confusing information. Sproutling understands that the life of a parent is a busy one- thus the quicker and easier a parent can absorb the information regarding their child, the better. Sproutling even terms the information they provide as "insights, not data," in order to not overwhelm their users. In addition, Sproutling understands that images rather than large amounts of text resonate better with users. When referencing its app, Sproutling also notes that, "it's not about numbers, it's about useful insights that help you get rid of guesswork." When it comes to any IoT app for monitoring/tracking information, this is certainly a smart mentality worth embracing.

# Usability

In conjunction with connectivity and clarity, usability is more crucial than ever before. A lot of IoT devices on the market or emerging on the market are all about making an element of your home and/or an object in your daily life "smarter". This movement of making smart devices, stimulates the need for more interactive applications, thus placing an increased emphasis on usability. Usability testing is also more critical than ever before in order to ensure that your app's usability is up to par in the realm of IoT.

In this particular usage case of making objects smarter, your application in essence functions as the nifty "remote control" for your connected device. "The basic purpose of a device should nearly always be the main focal point of an application," [says Alex Brisbourne](http://www.sitepoint.com/unique-ux-challenges-internet-of-things/), President of KORE. "If users have difficulty completing the basic tasks that they can easily do with their dumb devices, then the UI of the application has failed." Brisbourne hits the nail directly on the head with this statement. Be deficient in intuitive usability, and you automatically threaten your user experience and retention and undermine the fundamental "smartness" of your technology. A smart device with a "dumb" app is utterly hypocritical, but unfortunately it does happen.

Yet let's take a look at [Nest app](https://nest.com/blog/2015/06/17/one-home-one-app/), which epitomizes a winning combination of innovativeness and usability. The Nest app, as any IoT app, naturally adds a layer of complexity to the target device by serving as a new source of control. Thus, usability must be first-rate in order for the user to actually want to utilize the app. The Nest app fulfills this requisite by serving as both a seamless control hub for the user and smoothly expanding the unique authority of the user beyond the interactions they are used to. Not only is it clean and aesthetically pleasing, Nest also allows its user to control all of its smart home facets in one place. "The Nest product people use most isn't the thermostat on the wall, the smoke alarm on the ceiling, or the camera on the mantle. It's the Nest app," the founder of Nest, Matt Rodgers, states. "The app is what lets people take our products with them anywhere. It's what connects them to home." This quote perfectly encapsulates the overall power and value of an IoT app with high-caliber usability, especially in terms of functioning as a touchpoint for device adoption and loyalty.
