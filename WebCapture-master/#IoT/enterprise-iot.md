You might have noticed over the past couple of years a pretty significant influx of small embedded computing devices, right? Maybe? And how they're being both used and misused to pretty significant effects?

Yeah, well, let's hope so. Especially if you're in this section of DZone.

As an industry, we've been spending our time talking about things like how we're going to secure them, or how they're going to reinvent certain markets, or how big those markets are going to be in five years.

We haven't been talking about one significant problem with IoT -- how are companies going to use and track these devices? And how are they going to impact things like computation modeling or architecture work?

Are companies going to be able to use IoT to increase their overall computing capabilities? Are we going to have parallel processor farms consisting of IoT devices?

In effect, companies are going to have an entire shadow architecture of systems in their businesses. And some of those devices may have audio/visual capabilities too. They might have smart plugs managing their energy use. They might have smart cameras helping with security, trained on specific locations. They might have smart bulbs installed in key locations just because it looks nice. And each of these devices run a MIPS or ARM chip, and likely have an embedded version of Linux running. Imagine -- you could have four or five Linux systems in your office alone.

We've seen these devices used in DDoS attacks with devastating results; why not harness that unused computational power to do something with more business impact? This isn't hard to imagine -- perhaps each IoT device also runs MPI over an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. If each office has five of these devices, imagine the kind of computation power in a company with 100 employees. Or 1,000. We've seen cloud computing clusters of Rasberry Pis. What if we had 5,000 of these to play with?

What could you do with these systems?
