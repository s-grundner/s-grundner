The modern world revolves around a network of connected things. We're constantly using or being monitored by a variety of different technologies, many of which are powered by IoT SIM Cards. It's now very clear that the internet of things (IoT) is becoming more and more prominent, not only in consumer tech, but in business too.

## What Are IoT SIM Cards?

IoT SIM cards (otherwise known as [M2M SIMs](https://www.infisim.com/m2m-sim-cards/)) provide the connectivity required to automate processes. When we want two devices to communicate, they must do so using a data connection. In most cases, it wouldn't be wise to utilize a standard cellular mobile SIM; this form of connection doesn't provide the critical functionalities that IoT SIM cards provide. But what are these functionalities?

One of these functionalities is aggregated data packages. Most businesses looking to implement automated processes require multiple IoT SIM cards at a time (often thousands). By sharing data across your SIM estate, you can reduce the risk of incurring charges for over usage. If one of your devices is overusing data and another is under-using, they'll both take data from the same pot.

Here are some more advantages of using IoT SIM cards in business.

## Maximizing Productivity

As we've already learned, M2M (machine to machine) and the IoT allow business processes to be automated. This comes with a few advantages. Machines are much more accurate than employees when it comes to completing a task as there is no human error. And when something does go wrong the IoT machine can notify an engineer that it isn't working properly. This way engineers can identify exactly where a problem lies, thus saving time.

The IoT also allows business processes to run 24 hours a day, doubling or (even tripling) productivity. Organizations utilizing IoT use this to their advantage in order to stay ahead of their competitors, but that isn't the only advantage. As processes run automatically, fewer human hours are required to complete a job. As a result, less time is wasted and more money is saved.

## Increasing Uptime

Businesses can also maximize uptime in remote locations with multi-network IoT SIM cards. By roaming the networks on a steered or non-steered basis, devices or machines can minimize the chance of losing the signal. Steered roaming capabilities enable multi-network connectivity providing the primary network isn't reachable. If the primary network can't be reached the device will default to the strongest network available.

Non-steered roaming SIMs work slightly differently; they don't use a primary network. This means that the device will always connect to the strongest connection available, no matter what network it is. Businesses can rest knowing that the risk of losing signal is minimized. This is especially useful for businesses using remote devices or for monitoring fleets.

## Managing an IoT SIM Estate

IoT solutions often come with an M2M SIM management portal to monitor data usage and to provide full administration functionalities. By monitoring which devices are using what data and where, businesses can control their entire SIM estate with ease. Full visibility of your IoT SIM cards can be vital, especially if you have hundreds out in the field.

Portals like InfiSIM's [NOVA](https://www.infisim.com/nova-m2m-sim-management/) also enable administrators to activate and deactivate SIMs, add usage alerts and even add security thresholds. These features not only reduce your risk of overusing data, but prevent your SIMs from being misused.

One of the main issues that businesses experience with their IoT solution is the abuse of their M2M SIMs. Employees would occasionally remove data SIMs from their device and put them in a mobile phone or tablet to stream video, etc. M2M SIM management combats this in two ways. Data usage alerts notify you when your data is reaching its predefined data limit. So if your IoT SIM cards are being misused, you'll be notified of before you use too much data. This gives you enough time to deactivate the SIM.

Security thresholds also help deter misuse of IoT SIM cards by enabling you to allow or block specific IP addresses or URLs. By outlining what your IoT SIM cards can access and what they can't, employees will be unable to abuse your solution.
