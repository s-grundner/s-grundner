The phrase "the future is here" is overused and has evolved into a catchphrase for companies struggling to position themselves in times of technological or digital transformations. Still, the sentiment is understood, especially in times like today, where the Internet of Things is quite literally changing the way we think about hardware and software. We'd like to offer an addendum to the phrase: "The future is here more quickly than we thought it would be."

Digital transformation, increased computing ability, smart hardware, and the growth of connectivity capabilities created a perfect storm of accelerated industry, and many were left scrambling to sift through the large amounts of information and solutions available. With that in mind, we wanted to provide some advice for companies across the industrial sector for the best ways to optimize operations for the Industrial IoT.

## **Upgrade Your Network and Throughput Capabilities**

Nothing can kill the ROI of automated processes more quickly than the literal inability to function. It's important to understand that as you upgrade machinery and invest in the software to run it all, those systems demand greater bandwidth in order to effectively utilize Big Data and analytics capabilities. Several options exist, but for most companies, some combination of industrial-strength broadband (Wi-Fi), narrowband, cellular, and RF communications will create the most effective network for the needs.

## **Invest in Smart Hardware**

This may seem like a no-brainer -- and really, in the not-too-distant future, you may not even have a choice -- but [the shift toward Fog Computing is gaining momentum](http://www.freewave.com/international-iiot-perspectives-fog-computing-global-scale/) and being able to run decentralized computing between hardware and the cloud can not only create greater operational efficiency, but it can also allow your data transmission to run more smoothly as well. The beauty of a Fog Computing system is that it allows a greater number of devices to transmit smaller data packets, which frees up bandwidth and speeds real-time data analytics. The core of this lies in the smart hardware.

## **Be Proactive About Application Development**

Smart hardware means that it has the ability to host applications designed specifically for your needs. Previously, many companies shied away from app development because it required highly skilled developers _and_ devices capable of hosting those apps - a combination that wasn't readily available. Today, the scene has changed. With [the rise of Node-RED](http://www.freewave.com/node-red-iot-programming-language/), it is much easier today to create proprietary applications without a computer engineering degree, and any company serious about leveraging IIoT technology needs to be able to to use the full scope of its data.

## **Secure Your Communications**

There isn't much more to be said about the importance of cybersecurity. If the last few years of massive data breaches haven't rung alarm bells, then you aren't paying attention. Cybersecurity today is a multi-layered need. Most companies building smart hardware are beginning to build encryption directly into the devices. But, since many companies use cloud applications for computing and analytics, it is important to invest in strong security measures at that level as well. Unfortunately, the sophistication of cyber attacks is only going to increase, along with the increase in importance of the data needing to be protected. It pays to be paranoid and act accordingly.
