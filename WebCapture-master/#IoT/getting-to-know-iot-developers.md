_Captured: 2017-05-17 at 20:50 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/getting-to-know-iot-developers-and-professionals?oid=twitter&utm_content=bufferf4ec5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)_

We've all witnessed the growth of IoT over the past decade. The question now is, how can we optimize our position to maintain and continue this growth? By giving developers the tools they need to create these IoT technologies!

In preparation for the upcoming _Guide to IoT: Applications, Protocols, and Best Practices_, we surveyed the DZone audience of developers and professionals to get a better grasp on the IoT industry. The survey asked about their work experience, preferences on various programming languages, their roles as a developer, and what software they are working on.

Stay tuned for the complete and comprehensive survey data, which will be published on May 22, 2017, in our Guide to IoT.

## Initial Findings from the IoT Audience 

  * More than 30% have **16 to 25 years** of experience

  * Primary job roles- **32.6% are developers/engineers**, 18.8% are developer team leads, and 16.9% are architects

  * 22% work in company's with 10,000+ employees, followed by 21.1% in company's between 1,000 and 9,999 employees 

  * More than 85% of professionals said that they read articles on multiple tech sites to keep up their skills up to date

  * 55.1% of professionals say that their company's **primary coding language is Java,** followed by Python at 8.4% 

  * 88.8% said they believe IoT will be relevant to their organization in the future 

### **Challenges Encountered While Developing IoT Applications**

45.3% of developers said that an **unpredictable physical environment** is their largest challenge, followed by **power constraints** and **device unreliability**_. _

## IoT Professionals on DZone 

To get a little more perspective on the IoT audience, we dove into our database and found:

  * **71%** are between the ages of 25 and 44

  * **84.6% of IoT readers are male**, and 15.4% are female 

  * 36.45% of professionals said that **opinion articles **are their favorite source of information 

  * They're primarily located in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Germany, Australia, and France 

## IoT Executives on IoT

DZone Research Analyst, [Tom Smith](https://dzone.com/users/1450207/ctsmithiii.html), recently spoke with 19 executives on the state of IoT. His findings, while currently published in the [IoT Zone](https://dzone.com/iot-developer-tutorials-tools-news-reviews), will also be featured in the Guide to IoT: Applications, Protocols, and Best Practices.

Key takeaway:

  * **Companies are struggling to crack down on security for their applications. **This issue has opened the door for many companies to innovate, creating products and procedures to help IoT companies keep their data safe. 

Additional things to consider:

  * **The use of AI and machine learning is on the rise. **From new products to the new jobs are needed to execute their growth. Everyone is interested in how artificial intelligence will make its way into the IoT realm and what changes will be made to what developers are doing now. 
  * **Understand how to collect data and learn from it.** Knowing the right questions to ask will allow organizations to get more out of their data and be in better position for success. 
  * **Who owns the data? **Not only have developers had to keep up with the rapid changes in the IoT space, but they now have to learn how to manipulate it in many ways for many different people.
