[IoT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/) refers to a worldwide system of devices that are connected to each other. These devices change the way we search for information, the way we work, and the way we entertain ourselves.

Developers and technology professionals who want to build a solid IoT career will need to focus on a number of important skills. As interconnected devices are starting to play a more important role in our lives, a new skillset comes to the forefront.

## Acquisition of Knowledge in Key Areas

IT professionals need to be knowledgeable in various areas in order to build a successful career. Work in the field of IoT, however, necessitates intimate knowledge of various [key topics](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/just-getting-started-iot-consider-7-key-iot-concepts-skills/).

For a start, hardware understanding is required. As already mentioned, interconnected devices form the heart and the soul of IoT. These devices range from computers to smartphones and wearable technology. To transmit data, these devices need to be capable of processing information in a certain way.

Developers will also have to focus on networking considerations, app design, the new security challenges that stem from a myriad of devices connected to each other, intelligence, and the collection of diversified data and machine learning.

## User Experience Understanding

People use different devices to access IoT functionality in specific ways. Thus, developers should know what it takes to enhance the user experience, regardless of the interconnected device being used and its specifics.

IoT produces a number of [UX challenges](https://uxmag.com/articles/whats-different-about-user-experience-design-for-the-internet-of-things) because developers have to work across channels/platforms and still guarantee impeccable functionality and performance.

Cross-platform design is much more challenging and versatile than producing something static (for example, a website that will be viewed solely on a desktop computer). Many of the new devices that people utilize don't even have a screen. In the absence of clever user design and functionalities, even the simplest of tasks will become a massive challenge.

Based on their understanding of hardware and networking options, developers should come up with solutions that stem from the diversified nature of devices being used today. Ensuring the ultimate user experience will be one of the biggest challenges and a skill that employers will be looking for.

## Business Intelligence

Whether a person is employed in the field of [writing](https://www.scholaradvisor.com/writing-guide/7-blogs-of-year-writer-bookmark/) or technological infrastructure development, business intelligence is going to be of paramount importance.

A developer who wants to build a successful IoT career needs skills in business intelligence. The Internet of Things gives businesses a chance to collect, store and process large volumes of valuable data. In order to make sense of this data and suggest improvements in all relevant processes, developers should have at least some business intelligence acumen.

Data center management, predictive analysis, and sensor data analysis are all relevant skills that can lead to a successful IoT career.

## A Focus on Cybersecurity

Connectivity is great, and it removes borders standing in the way of the acquisition of information and knowledge. The Internet of Things, however, brings new [security challenges](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3199886/internet-of-things/top-5-skills-needed-for-the-industrial-iot.html?page=2%5C) to the table.

Cybersecurity professionals are in high demand, and people who have relevant skills can expect to build a solid career in the IoT world. New security designs will be needed to address contemporary challenges.

Vulnerability assessment, wireless network security, ethical hacking and public key infrastructure security professionals can all expect to gain new employment opportunity as a result of today's interconnected world.

Individuals who have a thorough knowledge of data policies can also expect to gain new employment opportunities in the years to come.

## Mobile Development

We are rapidly moving away from the computer screen when it comes to looking for information, communication, and entertainment. The world is becoming increasingly dependent on mobile devices. Smartphones and tablets have their specifics when it comes to connectivity. Thus, a focus on mobile development will be essential for a successful IoT career.

Smart home technologies and wearables can also be controlled through mobile devices. Thus, mobile apps will become even more prominent in the years to come as the number of people who have access to such technologies continues to grow.

Currently, the demand is very high for Android app developers, as well as for developers that have experience with iOS devices. There will also be a market niche for experts that have a background in developing mobile apps that can communicate effectively with sensors and external hardware.

While these are some of the key areas to focus on, IoT developers who want a successful career can also look into an array of additional possibilities. Some other particularly marketable skills include automation, data design, IP networking, hardware interfacing, GPS development, and even electrical engineering. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will also grow in prominence, changing the way in which the IoT functions and the development specifics that will play a role in effective networking.
