It's a new year, so it's time to dust off your boards and get to work! New year's resolutions and all that...

Anyway, this month, finding ways to make use of IoT has been a popular theme. We've got a few DIY projects, but also some ways to make use of IoT by monetizing the data involved with cryptocurrencies.

In addition to that, the ever-present threat of poor security still haunts the Internet of Things. Let's see what's going on with Spectre, Meltdown, and some new research that could help identify vulnerabilities in IoT devices.

## IoT Around the Web

### An Echo-Compatible, Arduino-Powered Smart Light

I always do my best to include at least one hobbyist IoT project in these recaps. Short on time and imagination, I slipped over to Hackster to find some instructions for this [Arduino-powered smart light system](https://www.hackster.io/tinker-project/arduino-powered-smart-light-works-with-amazon-echo-9e20fd?ref=tag&ref_id=internet%20of%20things&offset=1) that you can control with an Amazon Echo. Given that I just moved and got a new Echo, this is something I'll probably just give it a shot.

### It's a Bug Hunt, Man!

It's always fun when Wired has something about IoT, [particularly IoT security](https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-way-to-track-down-bugs-could-help-save-iot/). I won't spoil how it's all done, but a couple of researchers are using an old firmware evaluation and unpacking tool to help identify vulnerabilities. See how it works and whether it really could be the solution to solving IoT security.

### Meltdown, Spectre, and IoT

And lastly, take a look at [this interview](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/arms-ceo-simon-segars-on-spectre-meltdown-iot-security-and-more/) with ARM CEO Simon Segars to see his take on the recently discovered vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre and how they'll impact the Internet of Things -- as well as what kind of impact AI is going to have on the IT sector.
