Discover how you can [take agile development to the next level](https://dzone.com/go?i=294434&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mendix.com%2Fresources%2Ftaking-agile-development-to-the-next-level-with-low-code-mx%2F%3Futm_medium%3Ddisplay%26utm_source%3Ddzone) with low-code.

Recently I came across the question of "How can we identify senior developers within our interview process?"

This was a very interesting question that required further thought and investigation.

## Initial Thoughts

My initial thoughts were:

  * Try the algorithms and data structures approach as described in _[Cracking the Coding Interview_](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) book. However, as the book itself states, it's not for everyone or every company or every situation. I personally am not a fan of this approach as I prefer to commit ideas to memory rather than their implementations.
  * Try the take-home coding challenge. I think this is a fair approach because: 
    * It delineates the demands of a developer (using their problem-solving skills to create business solutions).
    * It's challenging translating ideas in your head into quality code.
    * Provides time for a candidate to express their skillset.

## Personal Experience

I also reflected on my own experience some years back when I joined a team tasked with building a greenfield project. At that point, I had been a software developer for quite a few years and therefore considered myself to be a senior developer.

However, when I joined the team I discovered that there was a considerable gap between myself and most of the other developers. Effectively, I wasn't a senior developer but a step below - an average developer.

This lead me to conclude that seniority is not an absolute truth based on time served but rather relative to your surroundings.

Am I suggesting that a senior developer who joins a team that has stronger competencies or experience suddenly drops to the level of an average developer?

No, not at all, because there are certain traits that senior developers exhibit regardless of whether they have the same experience or competencies of their fellow team members.

#### What constitutes an average developer

One description would be a developer who solves a problem by getting it to work (regardless of whether they understand it or not) and then moves on to the next task.

#### What constitutes a senior developer

One description would be a developer who

  * Solves a problem by getting it to work and makes sure they understand how it works
  * Refactors the code until it is to a high standard
  * Adds a sufficient amount of quality assurance (this would be in the form of tests)
  * Adds a sufficient amount of documentation so that others in future will know why the system is the way it is.
  * Ensures that code reviews are carried out to: 
    * Share their reasoning about what problem they are solving and how they solved it
    * Encourage constructive feedback to capture mistakes and/or improvements
  * Tries to continually improve so that their knowledge is up-to-date and relevant to the team's needs.

## The Technical Interview

This can take one of two forms:

  * Provide a take-home coding challenge which is then reviewed as part of the technical interview
  * In the absence of a take-home coding challenge, one can try to assess the candidate's technical abilities by putting forward a business problem and asking them how they would solve it (they can, of course, use the whiteboard freely to visualize their answers). This approach is detailed below.

## Business Problem

Build a web application that allows a customer to log in, view, and edit their details.
