I'd like to curate a thread with all the learning resources I can muster. Drop your links and suggestions below, and I'll edit them into the right place up here ;)

We also have a good collection of books on our own store, here: [https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/books6](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/books)

Some of these I've found via DevFreeBooks, which is a useful resource for those wanting to explore beyond the Pi-specific resources I've chosen to include here: [https://devfreebooks.github.io/9](https://devfreebooks.github.io/)

# Python

The go-to language on the Raspberry Pi. And part of its very namesake. Python is the language you'll find almost all of our examples and libraries written in.

> "A Byte of Python" is a free book on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this is the book for you.

> This handcrafted guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.

#### Pimoroni Learning Portal Python Guides:

> In this series I'll be looking at a few of the more interesting aspects of Python and bestowing upon you a wealth of knowledge that will help you write shorter, better code.

# Electronics

Brilliant visual guides and explanations of many electronics engineering fundamentals.

A great breakdown of the many, many sensors you might want to use with a Pi.

# Git

An essential tool for sharing your own code and collaborating with others, git is a cornerstone of the Pi community.
