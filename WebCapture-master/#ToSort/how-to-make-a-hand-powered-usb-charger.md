We all know that when the electrical power is supplied to a motor, it rotates mechanically but when the shaft is rotated mechanically, the motor generates electrical power. So, in this Instructable, we will work on a small project that will utilise this above said principle on a geared DC motor to work as a electricity generator for making a hand powered 5v USB Charger for mobile phones. This device can also be used as a 5v DC power supply for various projects.

## Step 1: Watch the Video

1\. Remove the label from the CD to get a clear transparent Disc.

> **Note:**[Watch the video](https://youtu.be/qobAAPmfHug) to see how it is done...

2\. Take 2 plastic bottle caps and using Hot glue, paste a cap at the center of the CD.

3\. Flip the CD and paste another cap near the outer boundary.

4\. Drill a hole at the centre of both the caps.

5\. Take a 12v geared DC motor, fix the CD in the motor shaft and fill hot glue in the bottle cap.

6\. Take a wooden stick of about 10 cm in length, insert it in the other hole and secure it using Hot glue.

7\. Insert a straw over the wooden stick. This will act as the handle to rotate the motor shaft.

## Step 5: Procedure: USB Charging Circuit

![](https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/DAAM/IP08WHHR/FQ7DAAMIP08WHHR.MEDIUM.jpg)

1\. Take a small piece of general purpose PCB board and a 7805 voltage regulator IC.

2\. Insert and solder the IC on the PCB.

3\. Take a 1000 and a 100 uF capacitor.

4\. Refer to the schematic and pin configuration of 7805 IC, insert and solder the 1000uF capacitor to the input pin of 7805.

5\. Similarly, Insert and solder the 100uF capacitor to the output pin of 7805 IC.

6\. Make all the Ground connections.

7\. Take a female USB port and refer to the above image for pin configuration of USB port.

8\. We only need Pin 1 and Pin 4.

> **Note:** If you need to make an iphone charger then you will need to generate a voltage difference of about 2.1 v on both Data pins (Pin 2 & Pin 3) as well.

9\. Insert and solder the USB port to the PCB.

10\. Refer to the schematic and connect the USB port to the output of 7805 IC.

11\. Take the motor mechanism we made earlier, refer to the schematic and connect the motor wires as input to charging circuit.

> **Note:** If the Mobile doesn't charge, try rotating the motor shaft in opposite direction to reverse the polarity of current.

12\. Using Hot glue, paste the circuit over the motor.

## Step 6: Test the Circuit

Our hand powered USB charger is now ready. Connect a mobile phone to the USB port and rotate the motor shaft at a uniform speed. We see that the mobile starts to charge really well. However, the charging speed will surely depend on the current generated by the motor.
