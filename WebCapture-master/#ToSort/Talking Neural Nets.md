There is a multi-part lecture series on reinforced learning (the foundation for DeepMind). If you wanted to tackle a project yourself, that might be a good starting point (the first part appears below).

We've seen DeepMind [playing Go][2] before. We have to admit, though, we get the practical side of speech analysis over playing with stones. We are waiting to cover the first hacker project that uses this technology.
