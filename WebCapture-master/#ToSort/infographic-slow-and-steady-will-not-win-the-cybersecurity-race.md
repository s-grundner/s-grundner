Agile security is essential to any business, but the opinions over how (and when) security should be integrated into the DevOps cycle vary greatly. While we always recommend that you bake security into your plans from the start, there are often barriers to doing so depending on a company's use of the cloud and cohesion between Dev and Ops teams.

A [recent survey we conducted](https://www.cloudpassage.com/company/press-releases/cloudpassage-survey-finds-companies-want-security-as-part-of-continuous-development-but-arent-there-yet/) at the RSA conference found that the key difficulties in employing security at the DevOps cycle include: lack of resources, siloed departments, and the concern that security would slow the DevOps process.

To learn more about the key findings from our survey, check out the infographic below. Results were provided by 102 security information experts.
