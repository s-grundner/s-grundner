Mobile applications today are equivalent to what websites were back in 2005 when businesses were trying their best to lead the marathon heading towards web addresses.

Today, the same can be counted for mobile applications. According to a [report ](https://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/127636051988/seven-years-into-the-mobile-revolution-content-is)shared by a website, consumers spend 90% of their time on mobile applications compared to mobile websites.

However, this is just the one side of the coin. The flip side discloses something that can be a nightmare come true for your business. According to a [report](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/mobile-app-marketing-insights.html) revealed by Google, 25% of installed apps are never used, and 26% are abandoned after first use.

What invites this uncertain behavior? If we asked a layman, the obvious answer would probably be a poor experience. However, that term alone holds numerous other facts inside it.

The list includes poor design, unhelpful content, poor performance, too many notifications and ads, and more. etc.

The problem isn't that you are going through a tough time; the problem is you don't know how to get out of it. To get the second one right in place before your competitors leave you far behind, here are a few ways that can make your customers happy while using your mobile application.

## 1\. Starting the Journey

You have a [startup idea](https://www.peerbits.com/startup-partner.html) that will miraculously land you amidst the big boys of the Silicon Valley. However, did you know that even perfection requires a uniformed boulevard to attain its perfection? Before you determine how to move ahead, ensure that you have gone through all the viable outcomes in the near future or on a long-term basis.

Once you are done with all of the research and analysis, you need to move ahead with the planning process. The reason behind doing a study here is to further utilize the same facts and figures to mold your app into something that can satisfy your users.

## 2\. Planning

At this stage, you need to utilize everything you accumulated above. Keep the paperwork and scrutinized thoughts that are in your brain together. Let them roll together like a film strip and go through them symmetrically.

You need to study your competitors, keeping your target audience and their preferences in mind. Look ahead to have features that your competitors are lacking to provide at present.

Simultaneously, also you need to look for a mobile app development company that has a team of expert mobile app developers and analysts. This task might take time as you need to go through the web world looking for your best app development company out of the list of random top app development companies.

The reason behind using these two differently is that statistics and previous experience alone don't make a company the best choice for your project. You need to have a team of mobile app developers who can work on your project with the passion same as yours.

## 3\. Designing and Developing

Don't think that after finding your mobile app development company, your work is done. You need to discuss your entire plan with your mobile app development company. Share with them what you persuade with the application and the gap you wish to fill.

Based on these, the authorized team will create the wireframe for your mobile application. Once the wireframe is ready, they'll work out on other significant aspects of mobile application designing keeping in mind your target audience. This step is very crucial for the success of your mobile app, as this in future will create a better user interface and subsequently a better user experience.

You can also ask your mobile app development team to organize timely interaction with the team so as to discuss the project development progress and talk about future steps.

## 4\. Marketing

Marketing a mobile app has two steps: pre-launch and post-launch. Being at the former stage, you need to start marking your presence at different social platforms keeping in mind your target audience.

You can share screenshots and sample videos of your application. You can also share stories related to building the app, and eventually, you can route them to your application's landing page.

Moving towards the post-launch marketing, you need to almost repeat the above steps and increase your rate of interaction. Find new ways to attract your customers (gamification is one of them).

## 5\. Beginning to Work

If you are in a misconception that your work has come to an end after launching your mobile app, believe me -- you are on wrong track. You need to tighten up your shoelaces and pull up your socks. Now, you have finally landed into the vast world of mobile applications.

Here you need to mark your entity as a digital envisioner in order to sustain for a long duration and to keep yourself high. You need to respond to your user feedback and ensure that necessary actions are taken to resolve their queries.

Simultaneously studying of the market pattern, consumer reaction, and user response in context to experience also needs to be done.

## Conclusion

Masters of the app world are often seen saying, "You can't create UX." However, you _can _let your app users see the effort you are putting in towards delivering them quality.

You might not create a better user experience at your first attempt and you might not satisfy your users all at once. However, with time, it's possible. All you need is a mobile app development team who is as passionate about your project as much you are.
