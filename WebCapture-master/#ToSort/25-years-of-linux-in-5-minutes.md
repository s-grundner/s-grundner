Jeremy Garcia of [LinuxQuestions.org](http://www.linuxquestions.org/) and [Bad Voltage](http://www.badvoltage.org/) (a podcast) delivers 25 years of Linux in five minutes: starting with Linux's first steps as "just a hobby" for creator Linus Torvalds, to its staggering popularity today with 135,000 developers from more than 1,300 companies and 22 million lines of code .

It's a lot to cover.

**1991:** Linux begins with [Linus Torvalds'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) post to Usenet saying it's "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu."

**1992:** First GPL release of Linux; it was initially licensed under a custom license that had some commercial restrictions.

**1993:** After Linux was released under a GPL license, we begin to see the first distributions: Slackware and Debian. 100 developers working on Linux at this point.

**1994:** 1.0 release of Linux; the only machines supported were single-processor, [i386 computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386).

**1995:** 1.2 release of Linux; see more outside contributions to the kernel.

**1996:** Tux the mascot is created.

**1999:** 2.2 release of Linux; Linus Tovalds passes Linux maintenance to [Alan Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox).

**2001:** 2.4 release of Linux; IBM pledges to spend 1 billion dollars on Linux, and a new maintainer steps up, [Marcelo Tosatti](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Tosatti).

**2002:** Linux development moves from patches and email to source control management.

**2003:** 2.6 release of Linux; SCO Group files a lawsuit against IBM.

**2004:** The commercialization of Linux increases; companies want regular releases.

**2005:** Linux has some licensing issues, so Linus writes [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and moves kernel development to it (very popular today).

**2006:** First LTS (long term support) release of Linux, lead by [Greg Kroah-Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman).

**2009: **[Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat) market cap equals market cap of [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems), which at the time is the largest commercial Unix manufacturer.

**2011:** 3.0 release of Linux: Linus Torvalds says there's "no change."

**2012:** Linux server revenue sales equal that of the rest of the Unix market combined.

**2015:** 4.0 release of Linux: live patching.

**2016:** Over 135,000 developers from more than 1,300 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel since the adoption of Git; 22 million lines of code.
