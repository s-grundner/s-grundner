A "Router Bandwidth monitor" made with a Pi Zero and a Unicorn pHat.  
A python script gets the current send and receive rate from the router via the upnp protocol, then calculates the percentage from the maximum bandwidth and lights the LEDs accordingly. Full bar means 100% usage. In case the internet connection is down or the router is not reachable, it slowly blinks all red.
