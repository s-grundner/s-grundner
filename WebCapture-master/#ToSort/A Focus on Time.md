**Things like diligence, focus, priorities, saying no, time management, and the like are important. But why?**

This quote by Benjamin Franklin pretty much sums it up for me:

_"Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of."_

Focus, priorities, time management, etcâ€¦ These are important because they're about loving life.
