Find everything you need here to make your own [My Naturewatch Camera](https://mynaturewatch.net/terms-and-conditions). They are fun and simple (no soldering required!), take less than an hour to make and inexpensive at about £30.

My Naturewatch Cameras are the first of several DIY devices we will be making available. We have also designed an [RFID bird freader](https://mynaturewatch.net/freader) that we are trialling with local communities -- if you are an interested ornithologist or bird ringer we'd love to hear from you!

Finally we'd love [your comments](https://mynaturewatch.net/contact) and to hear what you do with any devices you make. New designs will be appearing every few months or so, so keep checking in!
