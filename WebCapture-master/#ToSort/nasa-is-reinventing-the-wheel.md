Imagine you're sending a rover to Mars. The rover's tires need to be light, durable, and also flexible enough to tackle a variety of terrain. NASA has spent decades trying to craft the perfect rover wheels, but something always comes up short in the pick-two situationâ€¦typically durability. Now researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center have come up [with a promising new rover wheel](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/wheels/) for the next generation of rovers.

The wheels are made from nickel titanium, a shape memory alloy that allows the tires to bounce back into their former shape even when they're severely deformed.

The story of how the team stumbled upon this solution is a classic case of how important cross-disciplinary knowledge is for creation and invention. All it takes is one person in a different area of expertise to solve a seemingly intractable problem:
