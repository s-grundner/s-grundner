## Updated definitions, examples and free resources

UX has a long list of terms and deliverables. The list is even more apparent when viewing job descriptions that seem to throw in the full UX glossary of terms. Factor in that these deliverables have been evolving and many terms overlapping, I thought it was time to revisit.

### Break it down

Task Flow Analysis and User Flows are terms I have heard for years. I decided to find out their 'official' definitions. However, a quick google search revealed that existing UX glossaries didn't have these terms defined.

In either case, flow depicts movement. Designers need to consider how the user will navigate through the website or app. Creating any of these flows will help the designer think about what happens to the user before & after they visit a particular page and focus on what is important. Besides being the first step towards creating a working prototype, flows can help developers understand how alternate states should work.

#### Flowcharts

Flowchart is a diagram of the sequence of movements or actions of people or things involved in a complex system or activity.

### Task Flow vs User Flow

Task flows and user flows are not that different. The goal of both is to optimize users ability to accomplish a task with the least amount of friction. They both help you think through the design before the feature is developed. If you want to get granular, you can define them as:

#### Task Flow

Task flow is a single flow completed similarly by all users for a specific action. Ex. Sign Up. Task flows have a singular flow, they don't branch out.

#### User Flow

User Flow is the path a user follows through an application. I like to think of them as mini user journeys. The flow doesn't have to be linear, it can branch out in a non-linear path. By determining this path you can see possible turns through the route and can optimize the user experience.

User flows can start off simple and help determine '[red routes](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/redroutes.html)' -- key user journeys. These can easily evolve into complex flows when there are many conditions and requirements involved. User flows are helpful in hashing out complex flows before building out the product.

> **Designing user flows leads to better results** for both the user and business -- [Morgan Brown](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/stop-designing-pages-start-designing-flows/)

### UI Flows

37 Signals has a [shorthand](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) for User Flows. They feel that user flows have the following issues:

  * Flows are hard to communicate during the design process.
  * Drawing out every state of a flow is too time-consuming.
  * And drawings become instantly outdated as screens change

You may want to give UI flows a try. They are a quick way to get started and in a time crunch may suit your needs.

Over the years, I have had to create flowcharts to communicate interactions. To give more context, my flowcharts have morphed to include wireframes. NNgroup recently coined the term [Wireflows](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/) to capture this new UX deliverable.

**[Definition:**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/) Wireflows are a design-specification format that combines wireframe-style page layout designs with a simplified flowchart-like way of representing interactions. -- NNgroup

Wireframes alone are not enough. Wireframes communicate layout and static content but not interactions. Flowcharts do cover interactions in detail, but they leave out the user context. Wireflows help document complex interactions where the content or layout is changing on a few pages.

#### Elements of a Wireflow

  * Entries and Exits
  * Steps. Ex: user action, system action, alternative path
  * Connections: Indicate the desired path and different possible flows
  * Decision Points: a point where a user must choose from 2 or more options

This understanding of possible user scenarios allow for a better designed experience. Any of the methods described help communicate ideas and provide a way to collaborate effectively. Below are a few resources to help you get started.
