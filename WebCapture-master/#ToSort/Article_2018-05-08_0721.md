It's comforting to have a fragrant spring floral house, as if you were in the middle of a lavender garden instead of the concrete jungle where you probably live in. For this, many of the different companies have created air lovers with a multitude of aromas.

There are lot of Air Fresheners in the market: from the old manual sprays, to timer triggered ones. The later ones, although automatic, are quite dumb: they will keep spraying even if you're not even close to feel the smell, wasting those not so inexpensive fragrance refills!

Wouldn't it be nice if your air freshener was capable of communicating with other gadgets and trigger only when you really needed it?

In this project I designed an IoT Air Freshener, using some 3D printing, a NodeMCU, IFTTT and Adafruit.IO. You can use this tutorial to practice several skills: 3d printing skills, soldering, electronics, coding, etc. It might not be very usefull, but it will be fun!

On the next steps I'll show you how I 3D printed it, wired the circuits, and made the code. In the end of this tutorial you'll be ready to develop your own triggers and make your house a more comfortable place!

Some of the knowledges used here were based on [Becky Stern](https://www.instructables.com/member/bekathwia/) awesome [Internet of Things Class](https://www.instructables.com/class/Internet-of-Things-Class/). It's highly recommended!

Always have in mind that this is an experimental prototype, and might be used with caution!
