[Last month](https://dzone.com/articles/august-in-agile), we took a look at a bunch of different topics. This month, I'd like to hone in on one: code quality. But, code quality is one of those things that means something a little different to everybody you talk to. So, I've slaved over my keyboard to gather the opinions of some experts on the subject of quality code. Enjoy!

## Quality Code Leads to Code Quality 

  1. [What Does Code Quality Actually Mean?](https://dzone.com/articles/what-does-code-quality-actually-mean?edition=323391) \- Is there any way to define what quality code actually looks like? Or is it like trying to say what quality literature is. Your college professor might say James Joyce, you might say Ian Fleming, and your little nephew might say Captain Underpants. Well, when it comes to coding, this article argues, there are certain qualitative metrics you can use, such as readability and business meaning, to get at a definition of code quality. 
  2. [How to Be an Advocate for Software Quality](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-be-an-advocate-for-software-quality?edition=324495) \- Did you know that the word 'advocate' comes from the French word for lawyer, _advocat? _Well, now you do! Read on to get one QA professional's opinion on some reasons, other than professional pride, to be a lawyer for code quality.
  3. [Code Smells: Too Many Problems](https://dzone.com/articles/code-smells-too-many-problems) \- OMG, it's Trisha Gee! This industry thought leader shares her opinions on how to deal with code that has so many problems you just want to wrap it up in a plastic bag and put it in the trash outside. The biggest piece of advice here is to tackle one smell at a time to incrementally increase the quality of the code. 
  4. [What Your Code Looks Like [Comic]](https://dzone.com/articles/what-your-code-looks-like-comic?edition=326498) \- From kitten to weird looking clone, to something out of Dante's nightmares, your code goes through some strange permutations as it makes it way through the software development lifecycle. 
  5. [10x Developers Are Good at These 3 Things, and You Can Be Too](https://dzone.com/articles/10x-developers-are-good-at-these-3-things-and-you) \- In order to develop code of the highest quality, you need to be able to ask three essential questions: what problem needs to be solved?; why does this problem need to be solved?; and what steps do I need to take to solve this problem?
