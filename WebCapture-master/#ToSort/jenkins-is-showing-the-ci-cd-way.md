# Jenkins Is Showing the CI/CD Way!

The need for DevOps innovation has never been greater. Get the results from over 100 business value assessments in this whitepaper, [Digital Darwinism: Driving Digital Transformation](https://dzone.com/go?i=291429&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.cloudbees.com%2Fl%2F272242%2F2018-04-19%2F8t38t%3Futm_source%3Ddzone%26utm_medium%3Dbumper-text%26utm_campaign%3Ddzone-sponsored-link%2520), to see the positive impact of DevOps first hand.

JetBrains just released the 2018 edition of their _[The State of Developer Ecosystem Survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/devecosystem-2018/team-tools/)_. It is pretty interesting, as it is based on a broad-based, cross-section of more than 6,000 developers and, as such, is likely to be a very good proxy of the market.

The survey analyzes multiple sectors, from languages to databases. Interestingly enough, continuous integration and continuous delivery are not in the "DevOps" section, but in their "Team Tools" section.

_So, what do we learn?_

With 62%, Jenkins is the leading continuous integration tool, period! Even if you sum up the percentage of the next four followers (!), you don't reach the level of Jenkins.

If you then split cloud vs. on-premise usage, the result is the same: Jenkins is the de facto continuous integration tool, well ahead of any competition. In the cloud usage category, adding Codeship (and, for some mysterious reason a second CodeShip, with a wrong spelling), puts the CloudBees ecosystem above 60%. In on-premise usage, the CloudBees ecosystem is even higher, at 66%.

As companies get serious about continuous integration and continuous delivery, it becomes obvious to all of them that they won't get an overall increase in velocity and productivity if they solely focus on new applications: they need to build their DevOps muscle across the entire organization. As such, their CI/CD solution must integrate with a LOT of different tools, systems and environments. This is a key area where Jenkins shines, obviously, with more than 1,400 plugins!

And that's typically where CloudBees comes into the picture. Once you move from a relatively well-contained Jenkins setup (typically an overloaded Jenkins master, set up years ago by a Jenkins aficionado) to a company-wide practice, concepts such as self-service, management at scale, collaboration, governance and security will emerge as key conditions for a successful enterprise-wide adoption of DevOps. From on-premise to the cloud, from self-managed to self-service, from opinionated to fully customized, as the CI/CD Power House, we have the solution that fits your requirements and the enablement services to help you.
