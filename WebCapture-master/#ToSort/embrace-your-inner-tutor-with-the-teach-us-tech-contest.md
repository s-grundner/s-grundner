Our latest contributor contest, the "Teach Us Tech Sprint," begins today. This time, the focus will be on tutorials - we can't wait to learn something new!

## **How to Win**

Time to put your teacher's hat on! For this contest, **only tutorials will count**. What constitutes a tutorial, you ask? A tutorial is a detailed explanation of how to use a particular tool or solve a specific software-related problem. Typically, they include numbered steps, clear instructions, and [code blocks or snippets](https://dzone.com/articles/code-blocks-why-and-how-to-use-them).

All tutorials will be posted at the discretion of the DZone Editorial Team.

The contest will run from **Tuesday, April 4th through Monday, April 17th**. At the end of that period, we'll be issuing prizes in the following categories:

  * **Most Pageviews: **Be the contributor whose original DZone tutorials receive the most cumulative pageviews during the contest period. 

  * **Most Tuturials Published: **Win by being the most prolific poster of tutorials on DZone during the contest period! 

  * **Best Tutorial: **To be selected by the DZone Editorial Team and Zone Leaders. 

  * **Best Series: **Also to be selected by the DZone Editorial Team and Zone Leaders. 

  * **Best Discussion: **The article with the most lively comments section (as determined by the DZone team) 

The winners in each of these categories will receive an Amazon gift card for **$200**. At any time, you can view the contest standings for the Most Pageviews and Most Tutorials Published categories on our [Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1smIEUVTsKrT93plpugU26olhGHk9gpJoyMpB2cjjUy8/edit#gid=0). Please allow one business day for the standings to be updated.

## Give Yourself a Boost

Want to win the Best Tutorial or Best Series prize? The winners in those two categories will be selected by the DZone Editorial Team and our awesome Zone Leaders.

New to writing for DZone or haven't contributed in a while? We have a brand-new [Writers' Zone](https://dzone.com/writers-zone) that is just for contributors, and it includes a lot of tips, guidelines, and ideas for inspiration. Some posts you might want to check out are:

## Just a Few More Rules!

  * Only articles that are "DZone Originals" will count toward pageview totals. That means that syndicated content does NOT count. That also means that posts copied directly from your blog or website and then submitted to DZone do NOT count.

  * All articles MUST be submitted by the author--no exceptions! 

  * All articles must follow the [DZone Article Submission Guidelines](https://dzone.com/articles/dzone-article-submission-guidelines), particularly regarding proper English grammar and spelling.

  * All contestants must be registered as DZone members and have an up-to-date and complete profile. By "complete profile," we mean it must have the following: username, bio, current email address, and a photo. 

  * At the end of the contest, before issuing prizes, all finalists will be reviewed for eligibility, including a review for pageview gaming and unauthorized content re-syndication.

## FAQs
