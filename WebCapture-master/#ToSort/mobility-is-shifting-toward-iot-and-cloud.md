No doubt there are considerable shifts in Internet of Things, cloud services, and mobile app development. The IoT's influence can be felt in almost every business; they must adjust themselves accordingly. This article covers some key predictions and advice to get the best out of mobility.

## **Successful Companies Will Use Mobile Lessons to Adopt IoT**

As of IDC's predictions, the global market for the Internet of Things will be worth $1.7 trillion by 2020. This projection seems to be quite promising, and we are able to see regular progress even now. Many companies have even started to make a significant investment into the technology of IoT. A survey conducted in 2015 on behalf of Red Hat brings to light that respondents were slowly but willingly approaching IoT. They had plans to roll out IoT solutions in the future.

Now companies around the world have started to take the concept of IoT very seriously and many are still in process of implementing it on more than one procedure at their businesses.

## **Mobile Integration Solutions Will Mature **

We will also see maturity in mobile app solutions. It may turn out to be more complex, particularly when it comes to integration, implementation, security, and management of multiple apps and large data. Interoperability is going to be the key technology, and networking, middleware, and IoT will become more complex in coming years. Standard solutions may be rejected because of growing favor for a broader portfolio of enterprise-grade mobile applications. Also, the cloud will emerge as a key enabler of mobile application development, along with MBaaS providers to expand their portfolio with more inclusion of the cloud-based implementation.

## **The Rise of The App Factory and Citizen Coders**

We will also see mobile priorities continuously shifting and broadening. More companies will show interest in creating "app factories" or a "Mobile Center of Excellence." Large enterprises already have these groups, but now partners may play a role to help small-medium enterprises. According to the Red Hat survey, 37 percent of respondents have already deployed these types of app factories. We will see more acceptance in 2017. The numbers will grow. Also, we will see the rise of the consumer developers who could develop apps on their own. It doesn't mean the demand for regular mobile application development will decrease.

We will see major mobile technology shifts this year and beyond. Not only will more mobile application development projects be implemented, but more users will show interest in apps, too.
