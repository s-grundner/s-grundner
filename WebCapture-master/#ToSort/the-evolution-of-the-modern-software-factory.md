Interesting insights shared by [Ayman Sayed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayman-sayed-41662a1/), President and Chief Product Officer, and [Otto Berkes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ottoberkes/), SVP and Chief Technology Officer at [CA Technologies](https://www.ca.com/us.html), during their introduction to [2018 Built To Change Summit](https://www.ca.com/content/dam/ca/us/files/brochures/built-to-change-summit.pdf?intcmp=searchresultclick&resultnum=4). During the 2017 summit, the theme was the need for all businesses to become modern software factories.

The way work is getting done is rapidly changing. We're seeing shifts:

  * From on-prem to the cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud

  * From customers and consumers

  * From CISO's to LOBs

These changes are happening faster. We are seeing self-learning combined with predictive analytics. This has resulted in a shift from managing projects to focusing on outcomes and value creation, along with a move from outage management to outage prediction.

How does a business deal with all this change? And, how does business invest in technology in order to be successful in the future?

End-user customers are turning to more software empowered businesses through software and applications.

Solutions and blueprints to build a modern software factory have four areas of focus:

  * Agility
  * Intelligent automation
  * Insights to improve offerings
  * Security as an integral part of the SDLC

Businesses are transitioning from monolithic applications to microservices. How businesses build, develop, and test CI/CD and DevSecOps is changing with automation. They are relying on AI/ML to improve consumer offerings.

The portfolio to support modern software:

  * Has the ability to integrate products across a third-party and open source.
  * Scales to support small business to large multinational organizations.
  * Has the ability to work across heterogeneous environments - build on every platform from mobile to mainframe.
  * Provides cross-enterprise multi-platform support to future-proof the technology investment

Because of this, the DevOps paradigm is changing to DevSecOps. Technology is driving change to be more responsive to the consumer with software and applications. The fundamental nature of software has changed in the enterprise, from operating the backend to establishing digital channels for their customer with shortened feedback loops to understand customer needs and business implications.

This requires fundamentally different capabilities, technology, and tools. Businesses need to take a holistic approach to sourcing innovation. This is comprised of multiple distinct models:

  * Invest in open source.
  * Have an internal accelerator culture that offers a framework for continuous product innovation

CA has a strategic research group explores the "hard stuff" around complexity and scale that will impact five to 10 years in the future. Its pillars are to:

  * Make security a competitive advantage
  * Build better apps faster with automation
  * Provide insights for better CX
  * Create a more Agile business
