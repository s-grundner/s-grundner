_The banana is for scale._

When I originally built the Raspberry Pi Dramble 6-node Pi cluster in 2014 (for testing Ansible with bare metal hardware on the cheap), I compiled all the code, notes, etc. into a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble). In 2015, I decided to take it a step further, and I started hosting [www.pidramble.com](http://www.pidramble.com/) _on the cluster_, _in my basement office_!

Every time I've shared the cluster with others during presentations or at events like DrupalCon, someone asks how it's built. While I _do_ have almost all my notes and instructions for building the entire cluster on the [Pi Dramble Wiki](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki), a step-by-step visual guide is better. Therefore, I'm posting a series of videos, "Let's Build a Raspberry Pi Cluster", to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/geerlingguy).

The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SvNkdTzUng) goes over hardware parts and setup:

The [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZugKrvxWIQ) goes over microSD card setup and Raspbian OS configuration:

These videos also serve as background material for those attending my upcoming talks on Drupal 8 and the Raspberry Pi:

I'll post again once I've wrapped up the video series (it will likely be either 5 or 6 parts total). What do you think of the videos? Should I consider making more of this kind of video, or ditch the idea and stick to writing?
