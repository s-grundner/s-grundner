Scrum is a minimal, yet sufficient framework for self-governing product eco-systems to create, evolve, and maintain complex products.

Scrum defines the ins and outs of the system:

  * The system works on ideas, suggestions, and options that are converted into a Product Backlog for reasons of [transparency](https://guntherverheyen.com/2015/12/11/product-backlog-upholds-transparency/) and manageability.
  * The system produces a valuable increment of product, a release candidate, no later than by the end of a Sprint.

Scrum defines three complementary peer accountabilities to balance all activities required for modern, Agile product development:

  1. **Development Team:** Converts the desirements ordered via the Product Backlog into valuable increments of product in no more than a Sprint's time, where a Sprint is no more than four weeks and often shorter.
  2. **[Product Owner](https://guntherverheyen.com/2015/10/22/product-owner-role-summary/):** Optimizes the flow of value, balancing innovative, novel ideas against desires, wishes, suggestions, and needs stated by the user base, the stakeholders, the organization, the teams.
  3. **Scrum Master:** Fosters an environment in which the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the organization get the most out of Scrum, using many possible [management](https://guntherverheyen.com/2014/11/26/scrum-master-a-manager/) techniques.

The system called Scrum might consist of multiple teams creating, evolving, and maintaining one product. It shouldn't supersede the minimalism of Scrum. The system works off of one Product Backlog and creates valuable product increments through the accountabilities foreseen by Scrum.

The context of multiple teams creating one product is often interpreted as an obligation for every team to be a Scrum Team, and every team to be a complete and full-time feature team.

Scrum doesn't define accountabilities as an excuse to fill positions. Scrum thrives on understanding the accountabilities rather than on blindly filling positions and claiming titles. Scrum doesn't instruct a uniform, detailed layout of the internals of your system.

Use Scrum to optimize the whole. Optimize your Scrum. Employ Scrum to build a product with multiple teams. Your system is expected to be a feature system, a system capable of producing valuable increments of product no later than by the end of a Sprint, regardless the setup of the teams. The accountabilities are expected to be fulfilled regardless the number of people it takes throughout your system.

Minimally, for _n_ teams working on one and the same product:

  * There are _n_ Development Teams, where the composition of each team is likely to depend on your context. Ultimately, the combined teams need to be able to produce valuable Increments while maintaining the integrity of the product. They self-organise to optimise.
  * There is 1 Product Owner, and most likely a distribution of product ownership. The form of the distribution depends on your context. Ultimately, the flow of product value needs to be unhampered, frequent and targeted.
  * There are 1-_n_ Scrum Master(s), depending on your context. Ultimately, the eco-system and the environment in which it operates need sufficient and sufficiently provocative support, guidance, protection, and coaching.
