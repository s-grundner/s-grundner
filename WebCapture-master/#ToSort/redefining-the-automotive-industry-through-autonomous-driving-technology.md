The automotive industry has experienced some major breakthroughs over the years. From manual cars to electric automated cars, the industry is still making revolutionary steps with the assistance of modern technology. Today, the leading automotive companies are trying to perfect the autonomous driving technology. Since the 1920s, tests have been conducted on autonomous cars in pursuit of perfecting the idea. Autonomous cars use LIADAR, GPS, Computer Vision, Radar and other sensor systems to navigate through the roads without your assistance. They have a control system that detects obstacles and other cars on the road, therefore, assuring you of its safety. The autonomous driving technology would transform not only the automotive industry but others as well. The benefits associated with the autonomous driving technology would be undisputed. Some of these benefits would include:

**Substantial decrease in road accidents**

According to surveys done, alcohol, inexperienced drivers, speeding, texting and receiving phone calls while driving and ignorance of the road conditions have caused many fatal accidents. Autonomous cars could eliminate some of the accidents caused by these factors. The intelligence of these cars would control the speed according to the condition of the road and weather. The car needs no driver, therefore, you can text comfortably without causing any accidents.

**Increased human productivity**

Taking a ride in a car that drives itself would be like flying in an Aeroplane or commuting in a train. People would finish up projects and take phone calls without having to worry about the control of the vehicle.

**Saving on fuel consumption**

Apparently, hard braking and speeding up according to the flow of traffic consumes fuel. Autonomous automobiles would save on fuel consumption since all cars would be programmed to travel at the same speed.

**Accommodating the disabled, children and the elderly.**

One of the flaws with the current automobiles is that it does not accommodate the elderly, children or the disabled. The autonomous cars would put the three groups into consideration. Just by programming the car to reach the set destination, the disabled, children and the elderly can commute to different places. The car can also park itself. The safety of the autonomous cars even though not yet unveiled to the world, can be enhanced by the automakers and dealers by;

**Educating owners on the limits of the car**

If there are any limitations to the car, people ought to know. The dealers and automakers should also explain the cockpit controllers and the navigation system to people once the autonomous cars are perfected.

**Fixing the infrastructures**

Bearing in mind that the autonomous cars would use traffic signs and roadway markings to navigate through the roads, the infrastructure has to be in good shape.. The autonomous driving technology could be the next big thing in the automotive industry. Even if it took several more years, the autonomous driving technology is worth the wait.
