Today's developers are the architects of the digital age, the ones turning code into websites and mobile apps that will define the next generation of technology innovation.

New trends, styles, and techniques mean that the task of the web developer is constantly changing. Web applications have become much richer and more complex. New uses of video, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence on websites will continue to define the developer of the future.

The web developer must continue to learn and grow, which is equally challenging because the technologies are constantly changing. The internet of 3 years ago, is very different from the internet of today, and so it will be in another 3 years.

Web development is typically split between front-end and back-end. The front-end developer uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code the website and web app designs created by web designers. Front-end developers are responsible for writing the code that runs inside the user's web browser, whereas back-end developers work on code that runs on the web server.

We've compiled a long list (just call it a "megalist") of useful tools that every front-end developer should have in their toolkit, split up by different segments. Read on and learn about some of the latest and greatest front-end developer resources on the market today.

## Libraries and Plugins

### 1\. jQuery

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries available, which front-end developers use to make such things as HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler. jQuery comes with an easy-to-use API that works across multiple browsers.

### **2\. Backbone.js**

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) is a lightweight JavaScript library that developers can use to set up and structure the client-side applications that run in a web browser. It offers an MVC framework which abstracts data into models, DOM into views, and binds these two using events. It works via an API connection over a RESTful JSON interface.

### 3\. Alertify.js

[Alertify.js](http://alertifyjs.com/) is a JavaScript framework for developing light-weight, high-performance browser dialogs and notifications. It's known to be a great option for adding basic style to alert, dialog, and prompt and log messages even on low bandwidth connections.

### 4\. HTML Boilerplate

Billed as the web's most popular front-end template, [HTML5 Boilerplate ](https://html5boilerplate.com/)is a professional front-end template for building fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

### 5\. AngularJS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) allows developers to extend HTML vocabulary for their applications and build those dynamic views in a way that is expressive, readable, and quick to develop. The framework collects data from the server, then compiles the templates locally for presentation, and does this through a client-side MVC framework.

## Templates and Themes

[Framework 7](http://framework7.io/#.Vd7TmPmqqko) is a free and open source mobile HTML framework that allows developers to build hybrid mobile apps or web apps with the look and feel of an iOS and/or Android native application. It also serves as a great prototyping tool to display a working UI mockup.

## Browser Add-Ons

### **14\. Window Resizer**

[This extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) re-sizes the browser's window in order to emulate various resolutions. The tool is particularly useful for front-end designers to test their layouts on different browser resolutions.

### **15\. ColorZilla**

[ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/) is a Firefox add-on that assists web developers and graphic designers with color related tasks by allowing them to get a color reading from any point in the browser, and then quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program.
