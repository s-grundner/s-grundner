The 21st-century can be seen as the new frontier in terms of technological advancements. It is widely evident that technology has made our lives easier than ever. As such, more and more people are starting to become programmers. However, very few people tend to stand out from the rest. Here are the six skills that separate the great from the good:

#### 1) Strong Communication Skills:

Great programmers tend to have strong communication skills. This helps them to effectively understand the task and perform well. Furthermore, they are able to better connect with others and this makes them function more effectively in a team environment.

#### 2) Genuine Curiosity:

Having a sense of curiosity is important in the field of technology. Being curious enables a person to think outside the box and it pushes them to do things differently. This can help a programmer craft more elegant solutions and look for ways to innovate.

#### 3) Having a Consumer's Point of View:

The ultimate goal of any programmer is to create products that consumers love. Often times, many programmers get caught up on what they want instead of what the consumer wants. However, great programmers often picture themselves as the consumer and begin to work backward in order to create user-friendly products.

#### 4) Time Management:

The ability to finish a project on time is crucial to the success of any company. Great programmers tend to master time management. This helps them stay on track and it enables them to be more organized.

#### **5) Fast Implementation:**

It is very common for programmers to stay up-to-date on the newest technologies. The ability to learn something fast has become the norm among programmers. However, great programmers tend to implement what they have learned. Whether it is a new language or a new concept, great programmers constantly put their knowledge into practice.

#### 6) Adaptation:

Last but not least, great programmers learn to adapt to different situations. They change themselves in accordance with the mission of the project. Whether it's revamping their coding style or working with new people, great programmers learn to adapt to different scenarios.
