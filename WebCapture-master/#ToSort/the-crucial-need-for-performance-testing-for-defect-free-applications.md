[Evolve your approach to Application Performance Monitoring](https://dzone.com/go?i=161135&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fforms%2FPA-APM-BMCcom-FY17-eBook-Form.html) by adopting five best practices that are outlined and explored in this [e-book](https://dzone.com/go?i=161135&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fforms%2FPA-APM-BMCcom-FY17-eBook-Form.html), brought to you in partnership with [BMC](https://dzone.com/go?i=161135&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fforms%2FPA-APM-BMCcom-FY17-eBook-Form.html).

Self-driven cars and super-competent computers by the world's Tony Starks are becoming the reality of the world these days. Businesses these days are focusing on providing their clients with a complete digital experience. Moreover, it is not just limited to load times and page speeds. This is the reason why performance testing has become a great responsibility for software testers, who have been adopting multi-layered testing approach beyond the regular stress and load testing plans.

Let's discuss some performance testing best practices that go beyond the limits of [performance testing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb924357.aspx) and that will prepare us to face broader challenges that cannot be addressed by just traditional testing.

## **Recognize Performance Bottlenecks**

It does not matter whether you are a proficient tester or a beginner -- you can never really judge when the next performance issue might just pop up. Therefore, whenever an issue occurs, it is imperative to initiate with individual components instead of focusing on the complete module. Though it is time-consuming, it can save you a lot of money and efforts.

## **Build a Comprehensive Test Strategy**

You must start with a comprehensive test strategy to determine the type of tests you need to perform to make the application perfect. Performance testing needs a lot of preparation and planning before the actual execution. You can know how tests perform better by the typical user by understanding the interaction of the components and the expectation of the user from the system.

## **Think Time in Testing Is a Must**

Think time usually refers the pause taken by a typical user while working on your application. Normally, this time occurs when a user takes a pause to view the information displayed across the screen when they shift from one section to the other. This time pause happens when a customer stops to verify the address or the details of the credit card.

Performance testing has a tendency to bring out the defects of an application before it can be deployed for use. Some performance testing techniques are as follows:

  * **Load testing**: Determines the maximum operating capacity of an application; judges whether the current infrastructure is adequate to support the application and whether the sustainability of the application in accordance with peak user load.

  * **Stress testing**: Tests an application under extreme loads to evaluate its ability to handle high traffic or data processing.

  * **Endurance testing**: Ensures the handling of a certain amount of stress over a long period.

  * **Spike testing**: Tests the application's responses to sudden large spikes produced by users.

  * **Volume testing**: Checks the functionality and capacity of the application under varying database volumes.

  * **Scalability testing**: Checks the effectiveness of the applications in scaling up to support an upsurge in user load.
