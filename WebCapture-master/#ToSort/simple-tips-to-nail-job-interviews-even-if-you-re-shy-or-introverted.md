Job interviews are extremely draining experiences, even moreso if you're shy, or if you're introverted and spend a ton of energy just putting yourself out there and trying to sell yourself proactively. There's no getting around the norms of the interview, but this graphic does offer some tips for people who find it tiresome in the first place.

Without harping on the whole [introvert/extrovert thing and what it really means](http://lifehacker.com/lets-quit-it-with-the-introvert-extrovert-nonsense-1713772952#_ga=1.62490604.1347662518.1465819317), the point here is to offer some helpful tips to people who find the whole process of having to smile, talk often and talk up their accomplishments and achievements, and be judged on everything from their style of dress to their body language (as well as their accomplishments and skills!) tiresome and anxiety-inducing.

Some of the tips focus on reducing stress, like stretching and planning in advance so you know how to get there, what to bring, and consider bringing physical proof of your successes and accomplishments. Make some of that preparation not just about what you'd like to discuss when it comes to your achievements, but also small talk you can actually rely on when it comes time to talk. During the interview, try to consider talking about your accomplishments as sharing information about yourself instead of bragging--just to make it less uncomfortable. Also, taking your time and making sure you understand questions interviewers ask you will go a long way.
