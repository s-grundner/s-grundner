There are multiple ways a hacker can tap into your enterprise and get away with confidential data or destroy your day-to-day routine, eventually reducing your productivity. Without getting into all the process of complicated measures to secure your enterprise network, here are few simple changes you can make to achieve significant improvement in your enterprise security.

> _1. Architecting Security Is Cheaper and Smarter_

Most enterprises do have a firewall to restrict unauthorized access to their network. But these firewalls tend to have a hard external shell with a gushy center. Hackers can easily get beyond this firewall and tap into the gushy center using phishing techniques.

By architecting your network by partitioning them into multiple zones and microzones, you can protect your servers and workstations independently. Even if the attackers make a move, only your workstations will fail while your servers are still safe and clean. Hackers may feel they were successful while it was only partially successful.

### **2\. Be Deceptive**

Deception technologies will facilitate the security process for the defender and make it hard for the attacker. Hackers will always target vulnerabilities like IP addresses, protocol space, and web servers. With deception, the attackers will fall for the trap and start attacking the deception rather than the actual web server, which is kept hidden. After attacking multiple times, the deception will identify too many breach attempts from a single channel and will block it for a while thereby protecting your enterprise. For example, the use of a forwarding server that acts as a decoy to protect your main server or employing [honeypots](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/honey-pot).

### **3\. Defining Security Policies**

Security policies are the place where security implementation gets its start. Security policies help to keep your enterprise away from threats by defining a procedure to access your network. Security policies have to keep your enterprise secure and away from external threats. Hence they have to be defined in such a way that they will address those threats, formulate strategies to mitigate those threats, and it should also be capable of recovering your enterprise if those threats have already breached your network.

### **4\. Need Longer and Stronger Passwords**

One of the most common forms of cyberattacks is 'password attacks.' This attack does not require any malware or software to run on your system. This is done using a software which runs on a hacker's system that performs brute force attacks (a trial and error method to make random guesses using an automated password generating software). These sorts of attacks can be avoided by employing a strong password. Brute force attacks can break a password with lowercase letters in a matter of minutes, so add an additional layer of security by locking the account after 10 continuous failed attempts.

### **5\. Alerts and Password Change**

An alert message asking users to update their password periodically will help, because even if hackers obtain a user's password through some means, by the time they try to use it, that password would have expired or changed. This will eventually improve your desktop management, and all you to make sure your remote computers are secure.

### **6\. Avoid OS and Software Vulnerabilities**

A very famous incident like the Heartbleed bug, Clandestine Fox, etc., all had one reason for their break - out of date software. [Keeping your software and OS updated ](http://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/windows-patch-management.html?dzone-7simple)will leave little chance for a security breach in your enterprise. Any Microsoft, Mac, Linux or third party patches have to be applied periodically to keep your enterprise protected against vulnerabilities.

### **7\. Detect and Eliminate Unwanted Software**

Users will use certain software which may not be necessary for your enterprise. Unwanted execution of EXE files may introduce malware into your network, which will eventually spread across and disturb your day-to-day routines. Apart from the above reason, the presence of unwanted software will become a distraction and reduce your overall productivity too.

These are seven simple techniques to keep your enterprise secured with tranquility. Practise it and expertise it.
