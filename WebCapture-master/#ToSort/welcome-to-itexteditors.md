## The iOS Text Editor roundup

This is a feature comparison of text editors on iOS. The information was initially compiled by [the web community](http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) on an open Google spreadsheet. It's meant to help you find the most useful way to write, code or take notes for your personal needs. Every editor is geared toward a slightly different purpose, with their own strengths and focus.

Hover over an app's title in the chart to see additional features which might not be included in the default criteria, and click the app name to scroll to its full data block. Holding down command while hovering over the body of the chart will highlight the current row, and clicking a row will highlight it permanently. Clicking a feature header at the top will filter to show only apps that have that feature. App details below the chart are pulled live from the App Store API.

## Corrections and additions

This tool is only useful if it's accurate and up-to-date. If you're the developer of an iOS text editing app (or a dedicated user), just use the [submission form](http://brettterpstra.wufoo.com/forms/ios-text-editors/) to request a listing. Corrections welcome, just use the same form and edit only affected fields and/or add a note at the bottom. Be sure to include contact info!

## You forgot aboutâ€¦

No, I didn't. See above. If you Tweet me and tell me I forgot something, I'll know you didn't read this.

## Shameless self-promotion

If you're editing Markdown, there's a great Mac app called [Marked](http://marked2app.com) that previews your work, updating every time you save. If you're editing on an iOS Dropbox or iCloud-capable application, you can even preview iOS work on your Mac as the document syncs back to the cloud. It can also export PDFs, Rich Text and HTML with a variety of themes and the ability to customize with CSS. It's neat. I know because I wrote it.

## To-do

  * **Mobile version**. I'm still trying to figure out how to make this more workable on iOS, since that's where it makes the most sense. Kinda doing this backwards.

## Key

  * **Yes**: Feature exists, see notes for any additional details
  * **$$**: Feature is available as in-app purchase or external premium add-on
  * **No**: Feature does not exist
  * **?**: Feature has not been verified yet
