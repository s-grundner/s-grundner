**End User Experience Monitoring also known by its acronym EUEM is the analytical process of understanding how a user experiences an application.**

There are many tools and solutions available to help with EUEM, and most of them revolve around 3 basic ideas:

  * User Experience Management
  * Synthetic Monitoring
  * Real User Monitoring

User Experience Management uses code installed on web pages to monitor and capture details about every interaction.

Synthetic monitoring tests the performance of applications from different physical and local locations.

[Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://www.nastel.com/tech/end-user-experience-monitoring/) investigates details of network packets remotely without needing to have code installed on each web page.

Together these three basic EUEM ideas allow for the collection of enough data to be able to see the digital footprints of each user through each usage of each system.

But this is like looking at a person through a telescope going for a walk--you can see them walking, you can see them stopping, but you can't see in detail exactly what they are doing.

What if you could see exactly what they are doing in more detail?

Wouldn't that be amazing!?

Imagine if when a user visited your website, you could see every mouse movement and keystroke, and then you could see that piece of captured information going through each and every part of your system, and how each system adds its own input and shares it with other systems. Now rather than following through a telescope you are following the actual transaction.

While before you would have seen the person, you were watching stop at a form for 30 seconds, now you can see that the completed form is passed to your stock control system, your accounting systems, your ordering process systems, your sales tracking systems. And in each system, you can see what the user sees, if the transaction was smooth and simple or if it was in any way confusing or delayed.

Now imagine if this transaction, every transaction could be viewed graphically as a workflow, and you can choose to segment all the transactions by different parameters that you care about. Maybe you just want to see any that are causing users difficulty, or any that include certain types of errors.

Now you are truly focused on [End User Experience Monitoring](https://www.nastel.com/tech/end-user-experience-monitoring/).
