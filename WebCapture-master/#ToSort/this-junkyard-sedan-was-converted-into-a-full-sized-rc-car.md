If you're looking for your next DIY project, consider swinging by your local junkyard. In the seas of junk and garbage you could find a few gems, maybe even a whole car. YouTuber William Foster shows us just how much fun you can have with a beaten-down old car and a little ingenuity.

Using a standard RC transmitter and receiver, Foster controls the car with a remote controller connect to two Arduino computers mounted in the center console of the car. Stepper motors are used to drive homemade contraptions to depress the pedals. A chain and sprocket system is used to turn the steering wheel, allowing Foster to control the car remotely or take a ride in the back seat.
