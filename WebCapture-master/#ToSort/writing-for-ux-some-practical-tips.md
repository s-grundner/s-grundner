### 1\. Clarity: say what you need, not what you want

Don't use words just because they sound better. Try not to use '_discover_' when you mean '_find'_, or '_retain_' instead of '_keep_'. This list is endless, but a quick tip is to think about how you'd say this to someone in conversation.

### 2\. Structure: organise your content

Format big blocks of text with headers, sections, bullets to break them down. Highlight specific words by making them **bold** or _italic_. This will help users read (skim) content better. Be concise, keep things short and simple. Use words that are easily understood. Take out the extra words. No fluff.

### 3\. Instructional: explain what to do

Write down the steps you want your users to take. List down the labels and buttons you want them to click on. Make this into a (numbered) list so they know exactly what steps to follow. Use the active voice wherever possible, as it is crisp, direct and instructional. "_Click here to review and submit_" is a lot more direct than "_This should be clicked when you are ready to review and submit_".

### 4\. Politeness: be empathetic

Things may not always go as expected. When something goes wrong, explain what steps the user needs to take politely. Users don't want to read "_Incorrect password!_". They would rather see "_Wrong password. Please try again._" This little tip is often overlooked and any technical jargon or text could mislead or scare your users.

### 5\. Contractions: use them, but with care

They're informal, conversational, and you'll be thankful they exist when you battle character limits. Just make sure you use the common ones (_it's_, _you're_, _don't_, _can't_) so you don't confuse anyone.

### 6\. Consistent: condition your users

Some words and phrases might appear in multiple places or flows in your product, so make sure you keep these consistent. For instance, don't use '_Reserve a Table_' in one place and '_Book a Table_' in another. While they might mean the same thing, labels and CTA (Call to Action) buttons condition the user, while they learn how to navigate through your website/app. Come to a consensus about using Title Case, Proper Case, or Sentence Case for labels, buttons, headings before you start. Keep building a style guide as you go along.

### 7\. Familiarity: write the way you speak

Use '_Your_', and '_Us_'. Be conversational and talk to your users, not at them. You can use '_I_' or '_My_' when you need to highlight the user's ownership of their actions.

### 8\. Abbreviations, acronyms, and jargon: avoid

Unless they're widely known and accepted, like days of the week (_Sat_, _Sun_), countries (_USA_, _UK_), and other common terms (_JPG_, _GIF_), of course.

### 9\. Negativity: no room for this here, folks

Be positive or neutral. Use the passive voice when you're giving bad news or if something's gone wrong -- it tends to come across softly. "_If your account is closed due to an unpaid balance, you'll continue to be a customer._"

### 10\. Inclusiveness: it's for everyone

It's best to use '_they_' instead of going the gender specific way. You need to be inclusive of your audience, you don't know if they identify as male, female, or anything else. Write for everyone!
