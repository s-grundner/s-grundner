Drafts is very good at displaying and converting Markdown to HTML. Is there a way I could create a note containing simple HTML and get Drafts to convert it to Markdown?

My use case: I keep my calendar in Google. If I put any notes in the Description field that might be considered RTF, e.g. a hyperlink, Google automatically converts the entire Description to basic HTML. If I can convert that back to Markdown it will be human readable again.

Thank you.

Sure, I’m happy to share what I have. Here’s a screenshot of the Workflow – I’m pretty new to using the app and I’m not sure if there’s a way to share that isn’t public like we can do on the action directory.

Here’s a simple script I created to demonstrate how easy it is.
    
    
    import html2text
    import urllib
    import sys
    import webbrowser
    """

    # Set html2text options and get text
    h = html2text.HTML2Text()
    h.body_width = 0            # Don't wrap text
    h.inline_links = False      # Reference-style MD links
    
    md = h.handle(html)
    
    if md:
      mdEscaped = urllib.parse.quote(md)

      webbrowser.open(xurl)
    

Pythonista comes with a version of html2text included, so you can see if this does what you want out of the box. I actually downloaded the current version of the module into site-packages, but I’m not sure how much of a difference there is. I had a specific project for which I needed HTML to Markdown conversion, so I had to make some tweaks.

If you don’t want to pull from a url, you could easily modify the script to accept the HTML directly. I hope this helps!
