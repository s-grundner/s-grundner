[Main](http://www.webopedia.com) » [TERM](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM) » [M](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M) » Refers to the design of any [system](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/system.html) composed of separate components that can be connected together. The beauty of modular [architecture](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/architecture.html) is that you can replace or add any one component ([module](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/module.html)) without affecting the rest of the system. The opposite of a modular architecture is an _[integrated_](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/integrated.html) architecture, in which no clear divisions exist between components.

The term _modular_ can apply to both [hardware](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/hardware.html) and [software](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software.html). _Modular [software ](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software.html)_ _ design,_ for example, refers to a design strategy in which a system is composed of relatively small and autonomous [routines](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/routine.html) that fit together.
