We all know about the to-do list. We use it everyday. Sometimes, we even obsess over it. We watch our to-do list shrink, and we watch it grow. Well, let's step away from your to-do list for a moment.

Instead, I'd like to tell you about another list. This list has power and can give you serious momentum. So what is this list?

It's called the "got done list."

The got done list is a list of things you've accomplished. Best of all, the got done list is flexible. It can have items on it that you've already done today. Or the tasks you accomplished yesterday or any other time in the past.

Here's the easy way to make a got done list.

### **1\. Stop for a moment.**

Just for a minute or two. Take a few deep breaths and step away from the screen. This is a perfect time to take a walk and get some fresh air. (Before you go, grab a piece of paper and a pen.)

### **2\. Think about what you did yesterday.**

If nothing comes to mind immediately, think of things that come to mind over the last week, month or even year. Try to focus on things that matter to you.

### **3\. Write down your accomplishments.**

[Paper](https://productivityist.com/why-paper-works/) works best here because it is more personal. When you jot down your accomplishments on the page in ink, it has more weight than words on a screen.

Now whenever you feel overwhelmed, or need a boost of motivation, you can briefly celebrate your success with this list.

Then you can move forward.

Want to make the got done list even more powerful? Make it part of your journaling or daily log. Just a few lines about the major tasks you've accomplished can fuel you tomorrow (and beyond). Put this list in [Evernote](https://productivityist.com/journaling-with-evernote/), and you have a record from the past that can help guide you today.

It's easy to focus on your to-do list. But if that is all you do, you're only looking at the missing pieces of the puzzle. Take a step back and gaze at what you've done so far.

The got done list represents the times you've done things right. The got done list shows the times you were productive. Even if you didn't get the results you wanted, the point is you accomplished something.

That alone is worth celebrating (if even only for a brief moment). Once you've accomplished something, you're able to learn from the experience. When you apply what you've learned, and you'll find yourself moving forward.
