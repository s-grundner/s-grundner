So, to help non-technical marketers get familiar with the mobile vocab, we've put together a list of the most common 51 mobile development terms marketers need to know. And if you want to see these terms in action, you can check out our annual Research Guide publications on the state of Mobile: [2016 Guide to Mobile Application Development, ](https://dzone.com/guides/mobile-application-development-11)[2015 Guide to Mobile Development](https://dzone.com/guides/the-dzone-guide-to-mobile-development-2015-edition), and [2014 Guide to Mobile Development](https://dzone.com/guides/mobile-development).

**Business-to-Business (B2B) -** A mobile application built specifically for use within another business.

**Business-to-Employee (B2E) -** A mobile application for internal business use (i.e. an enterprise app).

## D

**Data Animation -** The idea of exposing to the end user the change of data, provided the data is changing quite a lot.

**Device API -** A mobile platform-specific API that lets applications access specific mobile hardware functionality.

## E

**Emulator -** An application that duplicates the functionality of hardware or operating sustems for testing purposes.

## F

**Feature Phone -** A mobile phone with internet access and music playback that lacks the full functionality of a smartphone.

## G

**Gryoscope -** An instrument that measures the orientation of a device in order to orient display.

## H

**HTML5 -** A specification that defines the fifth major revision of HTML. It is often used as an adjective to describe web apps that use newer HTML, CSS, and JavaScript specifications (ex. HTML5 apps), or more generally as shorthand for the broswer as application platforms.

**Hybrid App -** A mobile application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses a web-to-bative abstraction layer, allowing the application to access mobile device APIs that pure web applications cannot access.

## I

**Internet of Things -** A netw0rk of physical ojects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with other connected devices.

## M

**Mobile App -** An application developed for use on small, wireless devices such as tablets and smartphones. They can be web-based, native, or hybrid.

****Mobile Application Development Platform (**MADP) -** A development tool, sometimes includinga mobile middleware server, that buildshybrid or native apps for each mobileplatform from a single codebase. IncludesMEAPs and MCAPs.

****Mobile Backend as a Service (**MBAAS) - **A service that connects mobile applications to cloud databases while also providing user management, push notifications, and social integrations.

**Mobile Consumer Application Platform (MCAP) - **A MADP for developing mobile consumer apps.

**Mobile Data -** Data that is transferred via mobile carrier from one smartphone to another.

**Mobile Enterprise Application Platform (MEAP) -** A MADP for developing mobile enterprise apps.

**Mobile Middleware -** Technology that provides application management functions that allow applications to communicate securely with on-premise and cloud-based applications.

**Mobile OS -** An operating system designed specifically to run on mobile devices.

**MQTT -** A messaging protocol that is lightweight and provides network clients with a way to distribute information.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) -** A version of a product with only the features that are absolutely necessary to go to market.

## N

**Native App -** A mobile application that is written in a programming language that is directly compatible with the target platform.

**Native Bridge - **An abstraction layer that gives a non- application access to mobile device APIs.

**Native Packager - **A tool that builds anative wrapper and native bridge around a mobile application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a hybrid app.

**Native Wrapper -** A component that packages a non-native app so that it is viable for native distribution.

**Near-Field Communications (NFC) -** A set of protocols thatenable two devices in close proximity (up to 10 cm apart) to communicate with each other. Supports three different modes: Card Emulation, Reader/Writer, and Peer-to-Peer.

## O
