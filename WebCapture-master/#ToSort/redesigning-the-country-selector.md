* **Lack of overview**  
Seeing more than 20 uncategorized options can be bewildering, and country drop-downs often offer hundreds of options (according to ISO 3166, there are 249 countries).
* **Unclear sorting**  
When shown a massive list, the first thing users do is figure out the sorting logic. But because country drop-downs often include the three to five most popular options at the top, the sorting logic is unclear at first glance.
* **Scrolling Issues**  
Multiple problems are related to scrolling large drop-downs. If your mouse cursor is outside of the drop-down, you will most likely scroll down the entire page, hiding the drop-down options from the screen. In other browsers, however, the drop-down will actually scroll as long as it has focus, likely leaving you with erroneous data.
* **Inconsistent UI**  
The UI of drop-downs differs from browser to browser and OS to OS. The drop-down will not only look different, but will also work differently. For example, on a Mac, Safari forces you to hover on two arrows to scroll up and down, whereas Firefox provides a traditional scrollbar. Now grab your smartphone, and suddenly the UI has dramatically changed again.
* **Lack of context**  
Mobile devices have very limited screen real estate, which means you have less page context when scrolling, and actually finding the option you're looking for takes longer.
* **Breaking the flow**  
Nearly all users -- even those who otherwise tab through forms -- will use the mouse when interacting with a drop-down, thus slowing their progress.
