Today we are showcasing two very different companies who have both embraced intelligent automation to accelerate test execution, reduce downtime, and prevent defects. Read on to find out how these organizations achieved 85% testing coverage and a 40% reduction in project timelines!

The first company, YETI Coolers, is a premium manufacturer of drinkware and coolers, and the go-to choice for outdoor enthusiasts, tailgaters, and backyard barbecue kings. YETI prides itself on creating outdoor lifestyle products that are tough, durable, and well adapted for harsh environments.

The company's rapid growth brought with it intense pressure to design and construct highly scalable processes. As a result, senior leadership decided to deploy SAP S/4HANA. With testing performed on an ad hoc basis and without a dedicated testing team, the need for functional test automation was especially high. YETI also needed its new automation program to prevent business disruption before and after their HANA implementation, and help achieve the following goals:

  * Quickly build and maintain complex end-to-end tests.
  * Maintain the integrity of existing systems.
  * Reduce production defects.
  * Improve the quality of testing.
  * Validate critical business processes to avoid business disruption.
  * Shorten testing cycles.

A second example of a company turning to intelligent automation for help is Citrix. Its mission is to build the world's and best integrated technology services for the secure delivery of apps and data, anytime, anywhere. Like YETI Coolers, it hoped to improve business process quality with automation. The organization's goal from a quality perspective was to provide continuous alignment of IT with business needs by enabling fast implementation of changes and enhancements. To accomplish this at minimal cost and risk, they needed to reduce downtime and prevent future defects within their business processes.

Citrix chose [Worksoft Certify](https://www.worksoft.com/products/worksoft-certify) to improve business process execution and gain operational efficiency through expanded test coverage. They also set out to reduce the user acceptance testing (UAT) burden on business users. Automation allowed them to make gains in agility by accelerating test execution speed, delivering solutions faster, and reducing production defects. Seamless automation made system integration testing possible and validated their critical end-to-end business processes.

Now let's turn back to YETI Coolers' company-wide rollout of S/4HANA. To meet stated goals, YETI implemented daily regression testing with Worksoft Certify to ensure flawless SAP business process implementation. It also used functional test automation to support customer-facing business processes on its external website.

YETI utilized Worksoft's automated business process discovery and testing to document and validate business processes and support SAP adoption. The company's IT teams used test scripts that mimicked the day-to-day operations of YETI's core business - this means that testing was based on as-is business processes. Yeti also used automation to conduct end-user and performance testing, eliminating manual effort in these areas as well.

While YETI and Citrix are two very different companies with different business needs, goals, and processes, both improved quality and visibility with the expanded test coverage that automation provides. This allowed each business to utilize its time more effectively, and significantly reduce the burden on its quality organization. As James Croaff from YETI Coolers noted during his session at SAPPHIRE NOW, "The quality of our software systems is how we can say that we've been successful with automation."

Automation makes it possible for the team at YETI Coolers to mobilize cross-functional teams to create a robust, unified testing program for SAP and its connected enterprise landscape. After just six months of using Worksoft automation, they increased the volume of their test library by more than 500 automated tests! In that same six-month period, they also **achieved 85 percent test coverage for their ERP systems and 50 percent coverage of all eCommerce processes**.

As for Citrix, it accelerated test execution speed with **a 40 percent reduction in project timelines**. It also saw a 25 percent expansion of test coverage through automation. This helped improve quality and reduce UAT burden on the business by 20 percent - saving around $80,000. Since adopting Worksoft automation, Citrix executes regression testing four times more often than before. They can now depend on reliable and stabilized test environments and can continue to increase the coverage of their regression testing program.
