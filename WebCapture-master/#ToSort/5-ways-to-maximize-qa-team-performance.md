A bug-free software is crucial for the success of any software project. To keep the system defect-free, you need to keep your QA team in top shape. To frame a strategy to improve the QA performance, you need to factor in aspects, both internal and external, that impact their output. Here are some tips to maximize the performance of your QA team:

## 1\. Plan and Communicate Clearly

Ensure that your testing team has all the information about, and an understanding of, the project and the testing plan. Planning will not only make the process smoother but will also help in identifying tests that can be run concurrently for more efficient time management. Changes, if any, should be communicated to the testing team in advance. Every app upgrade that requires additional testing cycles should be planned for in advance. Additionally, the size of an update or feature should be considered in your testing plan. The bigger the update, the more work for your QA team.

## 2\. Involve Testers in Creating the Test Plan

By involving your testing team in the requirements gathering phase, you can improve the testing process. It is important that the business and functional requirements are clearly communicated to the testing team. This is an opportunity to provide the testing team with ideas, suggestions, and expected test scenarios.

## 3\. Promote a Collaborative Environment

Bugs found in time are valuable only if they are fixed in time. Ensuring a collaborative work environment where there is smooth communication between the testing team and development team will minimize the risk of insufficient bug fixing. Further, you can also track the time taken for bug fixing to plan the release. You can also use this data to bring down the number of defects from one build to another.

## 4\. Provide Opportunities for Learning

Encourage and enable your QA team to participate in training workshops and seminars. The more knowledge testers have about the software application they are testing, the more insightful and useful the testing results will be.

## 5\. Integrate an Efficient System for Bug Tracking

By providing a proper system with tools for documentation of the testing results you can help your QA team in tracking the bugs more easily. It is a good idea to track your testing efforts periodically to understand the effectiveness of your testing plans and also the bug rate.

With these tips, you can equip your QA team to reach their true potential and scale new heights with quality software.
