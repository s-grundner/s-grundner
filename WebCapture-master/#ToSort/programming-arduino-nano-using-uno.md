Hey Guys,

Recently I had just bought a new arduino nano clone (CH340) from ebay for my mini arduino project. After that I I I connected arduino to my pc and installed the drivers but not still working, After few days I just found out how to programme arduino nano using arduino UNO and it was pretty simple too! Follow my steps correctly to gain final results :)

## Step 1: Materials Required !

## Step 2: Connection !

**Connect**

**_Uno to Nano_**

**_D13 > SCK_**

**_ D12 > MISO_**

**_ D11 > MOSI_**

**_ D10 > RST (reset)_**

**_ 5V > VIN GND >_**

**_ GND Note :_**

**_ If your board's operating voltage is 3.3V then use 3.3V._**

## Step 3: Prepare Arduino IDE !

**When wiring is done.**

**_Now we have to do some settings in IDE._**

**_ Go to Tools >_**

**_ Board & select Arduino UNO._**

**_Select the right PORT_**

**_And Upload any code :)_**

**The settings is done. Now, open up the sketch you want to upload on your Nano,In Menu, go to Sketch & click on "Upload using Programmer"IDE will compile the sketch & upload it to your Nano. The RX TX leds will blink rapidly on both board, & you will see done uploading. If not, then recheck all the wiring & settings. If you get any problem or you want to give me suggestion, you can write in comment section below. If any error occurs please press reset on nano and even on arduino uno**

** Happy Programming :)**

## Step 4: Conclusion !

**I wish this Instructables helped you a lot, If it helped you please follow me. If any issue rise please comment below. :)**
