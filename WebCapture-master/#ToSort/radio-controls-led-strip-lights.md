We hobbyists love switches, controlling stuff and LED lights, this project is a combination of these elements,

I'm thinking on more ways to use the RC to interact with the LED Strip, let me know in the comments if you have any creative ideas.

The Remote control lights up the LED Strip using two channels, I wondered if it will fell responsive and it turned out to be very on point, even more than I expected.

The Radio Receiver outputs PWM signals that we connect to the Arduino. I used the ELE (channel 2) and the AUX POT (channel 5) to control the LED Strip. To read the PWM signal [pulseIn library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/pulsein/) is used and for the LED control [FastLED library.](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) The LED Strip is WS2812B Addressable LEDs (30leds/m) - 5 meter in total.
