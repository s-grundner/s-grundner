2015 is soon coming to a close, and the world of hardware startups has been changing even faster.

Over the past year several trends have emerged that will shape the state of hardware for years to come.

**First, the good news: more everything!**

Prototyping is getting better, with the usual platforms (Arduino, Pi) but also new ones like Intel's Edison and a few more. The price of those still puts them out of reach for low-cost consumer devices.

2016 and the sales of Next Thing's [$9 computer](http://www.nextthing.co/) should help solve that. [Voltera](http://www.voltera.io/)'s circuit board printer, which recently received the [James Dyson Award](http://www.cnet.com/news/custom-circuit-board-printer-takes-out-2015-james-dyson-award-voltera-v-one/), will in turn support faster PCB iterations for those creating their own circuit boards. Interestingly, [both](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer) [projects](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltera/voltera-your-circuit-board-prototyping-machine) got their start on Kickstarter.

3D printing is still there, with some incremental progress, more flexibility and materials. The breakthrough from prototype to product at low-cost is yet to come.

As smartphones kept improving, including more and more technology, and selling hundreds of millions of units, they gave birth to a flurry of startups leveraging the economies of scale of mobile components.

Startups are re-imagining daily objects and inventing new devices. Those are gradually finding their way onto people's wrists, into our homes, workshops and industries.

Supported by maker spaces incubators and accelerators, a fraction of this explosion of startups moves on to later stage financing. Investment in IOT startups is likely to hit a record height of $2B this year [according to CBInsights](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/internet-of-things-startup-funding/). Some hardware startups such as Fitbit, Xiaomi or Square have reached unicorn status or liquidity, further fueling the interest of investors.

> _Retail is also stepping up its game with a flurry of initiatives to:_

  * _fast-track them to retail_ with [Brookstone Launch](http://brookstonelaunch.com/), Amazon's [Launchpad](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=12034488011) or with [JD Smart](http://smart.jd.com/) in China,
  * _educate_ customers thanks to new experiences like at the [Target Open House](http://openhouse.target.com/), in San Francisco's Metreon shopping center
  * _bring the store to the people_ with [ShopWithMe](http://www.with.me/retail/shopwithme-store)'s smart pop-up store.

> _Yet things are also getting harder, faster, and more competitive_

Walk around [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/), then in any consumer electronics trade show and you will understand why the transition from maker to startup has become more difficult. Consumer expectations are higher than ever, and scaling remains difficult, with or without engaging with foreign supply chains.

Competition looms large and many "smart devices" are becoming commoditized rapidly. [Xiaomi](http://www.mi.com/en/) and its dozens of satellites are at the forefront of this: cutting out middlemen and using real-time online sales they became the poster child of what we call now "Xiaomization".

![STATE OF HARDWARE.020](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/state-of-hardware-020.jpeg?w=680&h=383)

> _STATE OF HARDWARE.020_

In just a few years, the prices of numerous devices have fallen by a ratio of 2 to 20. This [activity tracker](http://www.mi.com/en/miband/)? A mere $10. This [action camera](http://www.mi.com/yicamera/)? A fraction of GoPro's price. Those [personal](http://www.ninebot.com/) [mobility](http://www.airwheel.cn/) [things](https://www.facebook.com/HANLINsf1/info/)? They are mainstream in China already, and can be yours for less than $300.

More, the Chinese versions are not only much cheaper but often of equal quality or better made than their "original" counterparts (when those exist). Just how much profit margin is left with all those devices as they transition to commodity status (and into more hands)? And more importantly, which ones are next?

It's easy to get hung up on the IP issues. While they do exist in numerous cases (and are sometimes solved in unexpected ways like when Chinese personal mobility startup [Ninebot](http://www.ninebot.com/) [bought Segway)](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/ninebot-segways-into-the-future/), what is equally important here is to realize that the _supply chain is a weapon_.
