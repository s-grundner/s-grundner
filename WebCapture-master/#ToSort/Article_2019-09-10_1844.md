## Introduction to Programming Language 

The programming language is a language that contains a set of instructions that produce various kinds of outputs. It is used in computer programming to execute algorithms.

Thousands of different programming languages built and many more created every year but only a few implemented in the market or used by developers.

Only those programming languages, that are easy to use and understand. The classification of a programming language usually divided into two ingredients — **syntax** (form) and **semantics** (meaning).

### Syntax

  * It is the surface form of a programming language.
  * Most of the programming languages are purely textual, so they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation.
  * The syntax of a language expresses the possible compounds/combination of symbols.

### Semantics

  * The meaning of programming languages.
  * There are two types of semantics- 
    * **Static semantics — **The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. 
    * **Dynamic semantics —** The machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. _ _

But “Javascript has not interpreted java”. The language constructs are such as:

  * "If" statements 

  * "For" and "While" loops

  * "Switch, Catch" blocks function

JS is the dynamic capabilities that include runtime object construction, function variables, dynamic script creation, variable parameter lists, object introspection, and source code recovery. the common application for Javascript is the web server-side scripting language.

A Javascript web server would host an object that represents HTTP request and response objects for the Javascript program to generate dynamic web pages. The most popular example of Javascript is Node.js.

There are some databases like MongoDB and CouchDB which use Javascript as their programming language.
