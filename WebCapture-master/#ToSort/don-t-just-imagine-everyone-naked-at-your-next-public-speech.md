We all [fear speaking in front of people](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-speak-in-public-like-a-pro-even-if-its-your-fir-1762552672). Some of us are just better at squashing those anxieties--probably by _not _following flimsy advice like, "Imagine everyone in the room naked." Instead, they prepare thoroughly and thoughtfully and learn what keeps people interested. Here's how you can, too.

Sol Orwell, co-founder of the independent nutrition and supplement research site [Examine.com](http://www.examine.com), shares a very detailed look into how he prepared for 26 different speaking events in 2016 and drastically improved his public speaking skills. One major tip: Instead of putting stock in the "pretend everyone is naked" cliche, he accepted that he wasn't there simply "to impress his peers." He was there to share knowledge.

It's true: when you speak, [your audience doesn't necessarily know](http://lifehacker.com/remember-the-three-audience-truths-before-giving-a-sp-1758115278#_ga=1.171870245.460803763.1483850531) as much as you do. Relative to the audience, you _are_ _the_ expert. Additionally, Orwell breaks down his insight into the five key components of public speaking:

  * **Content: **Start with this statement: "Because of my presentation, you will understand _____" (fill in the blank). This sets the stage for your presentation and helps you build robust points around it as you plan it.
  * **Slides: **Slides should only be complementary to a point you're making, not the focus. As far as pacing, try to stick to no more than a dozen words per slide and have each visual come in one at a time. "If you spend more than 60s on a slide, you're slowing everyone down," he says. And don't forget to credit the original photographer and source.  

  * **Before the Talk: **It's not enough to be prepared _for your talk_. Be prepared to _deliver it. _That means bringing your own laptop, clicker, and presentation files via a thumb drive or the Cloud. Additionally, knowing the venue, your mic setup, size of the stage, and other small details make your presentation go a lot smoother. Take a shot if you need to because...why not.
  * **During the Talk: **The first few minutes of your talk are typically the most brutal, so Orwell recommends memorizing the first five lines to get you into a comfortable groove. And while you're on stage, look for someone who's really into what you're saying. Any time you think you're losing the audience, go back to this person to collect yourself.  

  * **After the Talk: **Make it easy for people to follow up with you or get in contact. If you have the opportunity, use this chance to answer questions, cement your expertise, and connect with people.
