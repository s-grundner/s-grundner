If you're a footloose creative soul searching for a more affordable and friendly space than a typical rented or home office, coworking could work for you.

Coworking spaces are popping up in cities all around the world. They allow freelancers, small business owners and independent workers to rent a working area that is shared with others. The setup is usually more casual than the fixed rental agreement you would get in a dedicated office space.

Business-savvy spaces also offer workers the option to upgrade to a private desk or an office space, letting the coworking facilities grow with your venture. Most also have additional business services, and all offer a creative environment for you to meet fellow freelancers and clients, to collaborate and work.

From coworking spaces geared to nurturing the next generation of tech unicorns to boutique offerings, coffee shops, amazing workshops, art galleries and even a beach locale, we've scoured a hundred coworking spaces across the world.
