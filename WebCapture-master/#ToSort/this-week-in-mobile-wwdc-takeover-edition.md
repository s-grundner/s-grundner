It's been a huge week for Apple developers at WWDC, with the introduction of headline features like [Augmented Reality](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) and [Machine Learning](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) in iOS, to smaller yet critical features like additions to SiriKit, and opening up NFC on phones from iPhone 7. Meanwhile, if you might want to start watching [Planet of the Apps](https://www.planetoftheapps.com/en-us), a Shark Tank-style reality show about iOS apps.

## iOS 

Here's the [official Apple summary](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS_11_0.html) on everything that's new in iOS 11. While the keynote is what catches the press' attention, you'll want to spend time watching the [Platforms State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/102/) to help you get excited about what's coming up. If you're really pressed for time, check out [Shai Mishali's TLDR](https://medium.com/@freak4pc/wwdc-2017-state-of-the-union-tl-dr-4955b5cd3a10).

Here's a rundown of the [Notable UIKit Additions in iOS 11](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide/ios-11-notable-uikit-additions-92e5eb421c3b), which include a few small, but essential updates.

You're going to love Xcode 9. Here are the [Top 5 Features to Look Forward To](https://medium.com/@guydaher/whats-new-in-xcode-9-top-5-features-to-look-forward-to-c2e64868270b). And yes, you heard right cord cutters, there is [Wireless Debugging in Xcode 9](https://medium.com/swiftist/wireless-debugging-xcode-b6e98e26e022)!

Swift 4 has some really nice features, but the headline grabber has been [JSON in Swift 4](https://medium.com/swift-fox/i-did-not-shoot-the-marshal-9e60aecec3d8) with the new Codable protocol.

During WWDC, Apple announced the [winners of the Design Awards](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/), highlighting the very best apps available. If you need some inspiration about how to make your app look great, this is the list to reference.

Apple have released this excellent book on [App Development With Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11) targeted at beginners who want to get into building their own apps.

Have you been struggling with approaches to caching for your iOS app? In [Lightweight Persistence in iOS Should Be That Hard](https://medium.com/anysuggestion/lightweight-persistence-in-ios-shouldnt-be-that-hard-c200677026d2), you'll get an introduction to the [Shallows](https://github.com/dreymonde/Shallows) framework.

Here are a few more projects to check out:

## Android 

Although you might be following the widely accepted truth, that val is immutable and var is mutable in Kotlin, you might be surprised to learn that you can have [Mutable vals in Kotlin](http://blog.danlew.net/2017/05/30/mutable-vals-in-kotlin/).

Now the dust has settled since Google I/O and the Kotlin news has reached it's peak, you'll see a lot more about architecture components. In [Android Architecture Components: Now With 100% More MVVM](https://medium.com/@JoaquimLey/android-architecture-components-now-with-100-more-mvvm-11629a630125) you'll see how to build a truly reactive mobile application. Meanwhile, here are some [Musings on Architectural Components, Realm and Room](https://hackernoon.com/musing-on-architectural-components-and-realm-and-room-and-a-look-at-reactive-clean-architecture-880c8df55abf).
