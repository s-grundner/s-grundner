**Original equipment manufacturer** (**OEM**) is a term used when one company makes a part or subsystem that is used in another company's end product. The term is used in several ways [each of which is clear in context](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation). It can refer to a part or subsystems maker, an end product producer, or an automotive part that is manufactured by the same company that produced the original part used in assembly.

Generally, an OEM is the company that makes a part that is marketed by another company typically as a component of the second company's product.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) For example, if Acme Manufacturing Co. makes power cords that are used on [IBM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) computers, Acme is the OEM.

Confusingly, OEM can sometimes also refer to companies like [value-added resellers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_reseller). In this usage if Acme Co. sells circuit boards to IBM for use in IBM mainframes, IBM is the OEM.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)

When referring to auto parts, OEM refers to parts and manufacturers involved in the final assembly of a vehicle--in contrast to [aftermarket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermarket_\(automotive\)) parts that can installed after the car comes out of the factory. For example, if [Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford) used [Autolite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolite) spark plugs, [Exide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exide) batteries, [Bosch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bosch_GmbH) fuel injectors, and Ford's own [engine blocks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_block) and [heads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_head) when building a car, then car [restorers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_restoration) and [collectors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting) consider all of those brands as OEM brands, in contrast to aftermarket brands (such as [Champion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_\(spark_plug\)) plugs, [DieHard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DieHard_\(brand\)) batteries, Kinsler fuel injectors, and BMP engine blocks and heads). This can mean that Bosch injectors, for example, are considered OEM parts on one car model and aftermarket parts on another model.

When referring to automotive parts, OEM designates a replacement part made by the manufacturer of the original part.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) As most cars are originally assembled with parts made by companies other than the one whose badge appears on the vehicle, it may happen that a car company sells OEM spare parts without claiming to have manufactured the part itself.

An automobile part may carry the designation OEM if it is made by the same manufacturer that made the original part used when building and selling the vehicle.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) The term [aftermarket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermarket_\(automotive\)) is often used for non-OEM spare parts.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) Car collectors speak of cars "originally equipped with [whatever brand] parts" and of parts that were "original equipment on [whatever make and model of car]."

When purchasing parts at national, discount auto parts retailers (e.g., [NAPA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Automotive_Parts_Association), [Auto Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Zone), [Halfords](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfords), [Advance Auto Parts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Auto_Parts), [Auto Parts Warehouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Parts_Warehouse), [Pep Boys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Boys), [Motrio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motrio), [Autobacs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobacs), etc.), many parts will have OEM prominently displayed but followed by a qualifier such as "meets OEM standards". Such auto parts are not OEM; they are simply claiming to have been manufactured to the same specifications as the OEM parts--specifications that may well be unpublished and unknowable.

[Microsoft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) is a popular example of a company that issues OEM software for their [Windows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_\(operating_system\)) operating systems. OEM product keys are priced lower than their retail counterparts, but use the same software as retail versions of Windows. They are primarily for direct OEM manufacturers and system builders, and as such are typically sold in [volume licensing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_license_key) deals to a variety of manufacturers. Individuals may also purchase them for personal use (to include [virtual hardware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hardware)), or for sale/resale on PCs which they built. Per Microsoft's [EULA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EULA) regarding OEM, the product key is tied to the PC [motherboard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) which it's initially installed on, and there is no transferring the key between PCs afterward. This is in contrast to retail keys, which may be transferred, provided they are only activated on one PC at a time. A significant hardware change will trigger a reactivation notice, just as with retail. However, a motherboard change for reasons other than a defect will officially cause Windows Activation to consider it a new PC, and will result in permanent deactivation on said PC.[[6]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)

OEM software is also not officially supported by Microsoft. Users will still receive all of the applicable system/software updates as retail users. However, other support services, such as installation media, are not supported. Direct OEMs are officially held liable for things such as installation media, although they are not required to provide it upon sale of a PC hardware, and may indeed exclude it to reduce cost. System builders have a different requirement regarding installation media than Direct OEMs.[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) On versions of Windows which require a valid product key for media download from Microsoft (like [Windows 7](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7)), OEM keys will be rejected, and the party will be given a notice to refer to the manufacturer.[[8]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)

OEMs rely on their ability to drive down the cost of production through [economies of scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale). Also, using an OEM allows the purchasing company to obtain needed components or products without owning and operating a factory.
