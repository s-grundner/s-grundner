# Technology Platform

## The World’s Best Automated Facial Expression Recognition

Emotient's products are built on a scalable cloud-based platform that brings together groundbreaking research on deep learning and big data technology and applies it to the mature science of facial expression recognition. It is this innovation across multiple domains that makes Emotient Analytics the most accurate and robust automated expression recognition technology in the world.

## Two Decades of Scientific Heritage

The science behind Emotient was honed over 20 years, starting with the early work of [Dr. Marian Bartlett](/about/leadership#marian-bartlett) and [Dr. Javier Movellan](/about/leadership#javier-movellan) at the University of California, San Diego. Since these scientists and their colleagues founded Emotient, innovation has accelerated, boosted by a team of seasoned software engineers who have built a cloud-based platform around this core science.

The Emotient Scientific Advisory Board includes [Dr. Paul Ekman](/about/leadership#paul-ekman) and [Dr. Terry Sejnowski](/about/leadership#terry-sejnowski). Dr. Ekman pioneered the scientific study of facial expressions of emotion. He developed the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) arguably the most influential approach in the scientific community for describing facial expressions in an objective manner. Emotient is the only company that provides automated FACS coding following Dr. Ekman's guidance.

Dr. Sejnowski was one of the earliest pioneers in the field of Machine Learning. He and Dr. Ekman led the first efforts to automate FACS coding using machine learning methods. Both of these accomplished scientists continue to make meaningful contributions to their spaces. 

## High Accuracy in Difficult Conditions

Emotient’s platform sets the industry standard for accuracy by applying deep learning methods to high-volume datasets that are carefully constructed by a team of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) certified behavioral scientists. 

Emotient Analytics delivers **>95% accuracy in the detection of primary emotions**, expressed in as little as a single video frame, in both real-world conditions as well as controlled environments. These brief flashes of emotion, or “microexpressions”, were shown by Dr. Ekman's work to be important to the understanding of people’s gut reactions to stimuli. Practically speaking, they reveal quite a bit about a person’s beliefs and their propensity to act or buy. These are the tiny “tells” that occur in the short period between unfiltered reaction and conscious masking of emotions. 

Emotient's technology not only captures these single frame expressions, but does so in the face of obstacles such as poor lighting, consumer-grade webcams, facial occlusions such as eyeglasses and facial hair. It also achieves this level of accuracy for multiple faces in a frame, potentially up to hundreds of faces in a 1080p video.
