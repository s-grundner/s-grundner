# Computer Science: A Playground for 21st Century Skills

_Captured: 2017-02-08 at 04:15 from [www.p21.org](http://www.p21.org/news-events/p21blog/2128-computer-science-a-playground-for-21st-century-skills)_

Computer science is an essential 21st century subject. These stats speak for themselves:

  * AP Computer Science A is the [fastest-growing](http://blog.code.org/post/150040749703/another-year-of-record-growth-for-ap-computer) AP course of the decade.
  * [More high school students](http://blog.code.org/post/145705852158/the-class-students-like-the-most) like computer science classes than most academic subjects. 
  * Computing occupations are the [#1 source of new wages](http://blog.code.org/post/144206906013/computing-occupations-are-now-the-1-source-of-new) in America (that's [16%](http://blog.code.org/post/143085018748/16-of-all-new-wages-in-the-us-are-in-computer) of all new wages). 
  * [Public attitudes](http://blog.code.org/post/139445414968/what-we-think-of-computer-science-is-changing) reflect wide support for computer science education.

Yet, only [40%](http://csedu.gallup.com/home.aspx) of U.S. schools offer computer science! The entire world is facing the same dilemma: _How do we meet society's need for a population and workforce that is educated in computer science?_

Europe has recognized that a 21st century education requires computer science. "Coding is the literacy of today and it helps practice 21st century skills such as problem-solving, team work and analytical thinking" ([EU Digital Single Market, 2016](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/coding-21st-century-skill)). Even though more than 90% of jobs in Europe nowadays require digital competencies such as programming, the education system has been slow to react to new demands. The United States, the global leader in technology for decades, has very similar issues and state education systems here are also[ figuring out](http://blog.code.org/post/154426322258/states-gather-to-go-from-an-hour-of-code-to-years) how to increase access to high-quality computer science. The [K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/) was developed to meet that need.

As described by the [K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/), computer science includes concepts, such as systems, networks, data, algorithms, programming, and the impact of computing on society, as well as practices, such as decomposing, abstracting, debugging, and collaborating. Below are [21st Century Learning Skills](http://www.p21.org/about-us/p21-framework) paired up with snippets of concepts and practices from the K-12 Computer Science Framework._ Notice how computer science provides a natural setting for developing_ _21st century learning._

**Framework for 21st Century Learning **
**K-12 Computer Science Framework **

Creativity
Create a computational artifact for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

Innovation
Modify an existing artifact to improve or customize it.

Critical Thinking
Evaluate whether it is appropriate and feasible to solve a problem computationally

Problem Solving
Decompose complex real-world problems into manageable subproblems that could integrate existing solutions or procedures.

Communication
Describe, justify, and document computational processes and solutions using appropriate terminology consistent with the intended audience and purpose.

Collaboration
Solicit and incorporate feedback from, and provide constructive feedback to team members and other stakeholders

But to be clear, when it comes to 21st Century Learning, computer science is not just an opportunity for developing 21st century skills such as creativity and problem solving, it is also a fundamental 21st century subject, on the same level as language arts, mathematics, and science. The federal government recently acknowledged this in the Every Student Succeeds Act, which considers computer science part of a [well-rounded education](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/president-obama-just-signed-a-law-that-designates-computer-science-part-of-a-well-rounded-education/). Let's make computer science a priority as we continue to push for a well-rounded, 21st century education.
