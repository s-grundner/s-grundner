** Explanation: ** Today, February 29th, is a [leap day](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapDay.html) \- a relatively rare occurrence. In 46 BC, [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar), featured here in a self-decreed minted coin, created a calendar system that added one [leap day](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html) every four years. Acting on advice by [Alexandrian](http://www.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html) astronomer [Sosigenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria), Caesar did this to make up for the fact that the Earth's year is slightly more than 365 days. In modern terms, the time it takes for the [Earth](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990131.html) to circle the [Sun](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000110.html) is slightly more than the time it takes for the [Earth to rotate](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140319.html) 365 times (with respect to the Sun -- actually we now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations). So, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift from the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years. Eventually July (named posthumously for [Julius Caesar](http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html) himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter! By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the [calendar year](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/) would drift much less. This [Julian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar) system was used until the year 1582 when [Pope Gregory XIII](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07001b.htm) provided further fine-tuning when he added that leap days should not occur in years ending in "00", unless divisible by 400. This [Gregorian Calendar](http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html) system is the one in common use today.
