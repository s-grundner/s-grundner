Hiring patterns for professionals have changed. An average employment longevity is three to four years. Plus, candidates like you are consistently looking for the next opportunity for advancement or to acquire new skills. As a result, jobseekers are creating their unique brand. This is especially true for people who are drawn to contract and project work.

**Why brand management**

As a jobseeker using online portfolios sites to show off your talents, you know that your profile isn't 100 percent "complete" without the headshot, personal website, work products, and favorite charity. Some candidates are going a step further by branding their resumes with graphics, photographs, websites, and portfolios to increase visibility and awareness.

From a marketing perspective, it makes perfect sense for you to add "curb appeal" to your resume or profile. Making an impression and standing out in a crowd is the goal. Recruiters and hiring managers assess hundreds of resumes and applications a week. You want to be the one who catches their attention for a closer look and the interview.

**Creating the brand**

Your brand is the best version of your public image. But it must still be you rather than just what you think hiring manager or recruiter are looking for this season. Branding yourself as someone else will, at best, lead to a career that doesn't resonate with you. At worst, inauthentic branding won't even land you an interview.

  * Creating your brand starts with digging in and truly identifying who you are:
  * What service, resource, or special ability do you offer?
  * What are your core values?
  * What are the things you are passionate about?
  * What is it that you do better than anyone else? Where do you excel?

You have the basics, now you need to craft this base material into the story you want to tell about yourself. This means blending these facts about you into a narrative that catches attention and holds it. Start with your top skills/talents and show how these are driven by your passions and values to deliver you, the "product."

The short versions of that story is a tagline that encapsulates your talent, passions, values, and area of expertise. The long version becomes your profile.

**Branding your presence**

Once you create your brand, you'll want to make sure your public presence reflects your carefully crafted image. Here are some areas where you may want to revisit the way you present yourself:

  * Revamp your resume and jobseeker profiles to share your "story" with potential employers.
  * Audit your online presence to make sure your social media posts match your brand.
  * Think about what you share online before you share it. Is it valuable? Does it reinforce the image you would like a future employer to see? If not, you may want to rethink that tweet.
  * Create a personal website that showcases your talent or portfolio and gives people an easy way to reach you.
  * Write for online resources in your area of expertise or about your passions.
  * Engage with people who share your values. 
  * Converse with individuals in your industry or the industry you are trying to break into. Become involved in conversations via social media and at in-person events.

Some of these ideas will make sense for you and your values, and some may not. This is your branding.

**Staying consistent**

You've added branding to your resume, created a polished online presence and you are grabbing the attention of recruiters and hiring managers. Now you need to bring the same polished brand to the interview. You have their attention. It is time to show them you are more than just slick packaging, and you can deliver on the promise of your brand.

Candidate brand management requires more than adding sparkle to the resume. It is about highlighting the experience, skills, and education that make you unique and able to add value in your next role in person as well.
