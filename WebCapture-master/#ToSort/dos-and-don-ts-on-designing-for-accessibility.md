# Dos and don'ts on designing for accessibility

[Karwai Pun](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/author/karwai-pun/) is an interaction designer currently working on Service Optimisation to make existing and new services better for our users. Karwai is part of an accessibility group at [Home Office Digital](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility/), leading on autism. Together with the team, she's created these dos and don'ts posters as a way of approaching accessibility from a design perspective.

## The posters

The dos and don'ts of designing for accessibility are general guidelines, best design practices for making services accessible in government. Currently, there are six different posters in the series that cater to users from these areas: low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers.

The dos, that run across various posters, include using things like good colour contrasts, legible font sizes and linear layouts. So, aren't good design principles applicable to everyone and not just those with access needs?

While this is true, the aim of the posters is to raise awareness of various conditions through good design practice. We need to be mindful of not just designing or building for our own immediate needs. For example, consider designing for keyboard use only. This is particularly helpful for users with motor disabilities where using the mouse can be quite difficult, especially with precise movements, whereas keyboard use is much easier.

Another aim of the posters is that they're meant to be general guidance as opposed to being overly prescriptive. Using bright contrast was advised for some (such as those with low vision) although some users on the autistic spectrum would prefer differently. Where advice seems contradictory, it's always worth testing your designs with users to find the right balance, making compromises that best suit the users' needs.

## The team

The content for the posters came from our accessibility team in Home Office Digital. Led by accessibility leads [Emily Ball](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/18/experiencing-digital-accessibility-first-hand/) and [James Buller](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/22/accessibility-and-me-james-buller/), we are a group of twelve, each specialising on these conditions: blind and visual impairment, dyslexia, autism and ADHD, D/deaf and hard of hearing, mental health and motor disabilities. Collectively, we learn as much of the conditions as we can to better increase our knowledge so they can be shared within and outside the team.

One of the challenges we faced with the posters was gathering information from our different specialisms and reducing the vast amount of knowledge to ten principal dos and dont's. There's also challenges surrounding content and graphics. I worked with [Nick Cowan](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/author/nick-cowan/), a content designer, who is leading on motor disabilities, to keep the content concise and ensure the graphics visibly represented the advice accurately.

## Next steps

We've shared these posters across government for feedback and they can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility).

We are constantly improving and adding to them so please let us know what you think. Understanding accessibility through design means we can build better services for everyone, whatever their access need.

**Update:** We've been asked whether these posters can be reproduced or translated into other languages. In keeping with the the GDS ethos of making things open, we've used a Creative Commons license which allows everyone to share, use and build upon the posters provided they are used non-commercially and keep the appropriate attributions (Home Office, Home Office Digital and the Creative Commons logo). It would be great if people can share photos of them being used on Twitter and can commit translations of the posters to our [GitHub](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility) repository so they're available for everyone.
