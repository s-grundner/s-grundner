Today, too many websites are still inaccessible. In our new book _Inclusive Design Patterns_, we explore how to craft **flexible front-end design patterns** and make **future-proof and accessible interfaces without extra effort**. Hardcover, 312 pages.

Did you know that bandwidth overage charges are (still) a problem and most users prefer not to rely on a developer? Well, I talked to 917 (real-life) users and created a guide to **help others find the e-commerce software that suits them best**.

I completed this guide by searching for websites built with e-commerce software (you can verify by looking at the source code -- certain code strings are unique to the software). Once I found a website, I (or one of my virtual assistants) would email the owner and ask if they'd recommend a particular software. Typically, they'd reply and I'd record their response in a spreadsheet (and personally thank them). Occasionally, I would even go on the phone to speak with them directly (although I quickly found out that this took too much time).

Here's what I discovered.

I calculated customer satisfaction by finding the percentage of active users who recommend the software:

E-commerce software Recommendation %

Shopify
98%

Squarespace
94%

Big Cartel
91%

WooCommerce
90%

OpenCart
88%

Jumpseller
86%

GoDaddy
83%

CoreCommerce
80%

BigCommerce
79%

Ubercart
78%

Wix
76%

Magento
74%

Weebly
74%

3dcart
72%

PrestaShop
70%

Goodsie
65%

Spark Pay
65%

Volusion
51%

Shopify is the pretty clear winner, with Squarespace close behind -- but both companies are actually complementary. Shopify is a complete, robust solution that works for both small and large stores, while Squarespace is a simple, approachable platform that works well for stores just starting out. (Worth noting: I've done similar surveys for [portfolio builders](https://www.wisebuyer.com/portfolio-builders) and [landing-page builders](https://www.wisebuyer.com/landing-page-builders), and Shopify is the only company I've seen score higher than 95% in customer satisfaction.)

But looking only at customer satisfaction is not enough. After all, e-commerce platforms have different strengths. So, I also asked users what they like and dislike about their software and found some important insights about each company.

**App store and features**

"The best thing is that you don't need a developer to add features… there's a ton of apps available." | "Their partner ecosystem is best." | "Shopify has any feature under the sun -- if you think you need it, someone already created an app." | "Access to Shopify Apps is great." | "There's heaps of third-party apps you can integrate easily that I believe are essential to growing a business." | "So many third-party apps, templates that other platforms aren't popular enough to have." | "There are many apps that can help with customization issues." | "There are a ton of great third-party apps for extended functionality."

**Ease of use**

"Easy to set up without having specific skills." | "Intuitive user interface." | "Simple to use." | "It is very easy to start selling online." | "Easy UI, pretty intuitive." | "The interface is excellent for managing e-commerce." | "It's really clean and easy to manage." | "Shopify provides a very straightforward way to add products, edit options and to apply different themes." | "More than anything, very simple." | "It's simple and intuitive." | "Very user-friendly." | "Super user-friendly for non-computer guys like myself." | "The back end is exceptional."

> _Users love Shopify's App Store. (_

**Ease of use**

"It's very easy to use." | "The e-commerce is so easy to use." | "It's easy to configure, simple to add, delete and modify our inventory, and most importantly it allows us to easily keep track of our ins and outs with helpful metrics and sales graphs." | "It's very easy to set up." | "The user interface is easy to use." | "Commerce is really nice and easy to set up." | "Love the interface, very easy to work with." | "I find it easy to use." | "It was pretty easy to set up and has been a snap to maintain." | "It's all pretty smooth and easy." | "It's super-easy." | "I've tried Drupal, WordPress… the interface and creative ability of Squarespace is much superior."

**Limitations**

"The only thing I would say they need to improve is allowing more than one currency on the e-commerce site, which currently is not available." | "It works pretty good for basic sales of items." | "There are some limitations in terms of customizing, but they are minor." | "If you are using it as is and just need the limited feature set that it comes with, it's a great option." | "Overall, it's great for putting a few simple products up, but if you need anything beyond their default cart options, get a proper Squarespace developer or someone to set up a Shopify site for you." | "It is really a great place to start, but unfortunately a place that is easily transitioned out of once the business begins to grow."

**Shipping**

"My partners have had some concerns with the shipping aspect, though." | "Yes, I would recommend it, but Squarespace needs to have calculated shipping for all the plans." | "The shipping is still something I wish was a little easier." | "The only thing I would say is that, for me, the shipping options are more limited than I would like." | "There are some features I wish were better implemented in the base package (like shipping integration for international orders), but I'd recommend it."

This is an amazing feature." | "Their prices are also very reasonable."

**Limitations**

"Lacking in features." | "It is limited in terms of themes… You always know when you're on a Big Cartel site." | "It does most of what I expect of it, but also has limitations." | "The one problem I have is that the only options for receiving payments are PayPal and Stripe." | "If you want more of an interactive site with blogs and videos and whatnot, I think there are better options out there." | "We are currently moving over to Shopify because we have maxed out Big Cartel's limited 300-item store capacity. That is the only downside of Big Cartel." | "You are limited by what Big Cartel allows you to do. For example, there are certain promotions that I would like to do, but currently Big Cartel has no way of allowing it."

"The ecosystem is well supported." | "Great support with a whole online community dedicated to it." | "I'm always able to find the answer to any question I have, either through the official WooCommerce knowledge base or in the community forums."

"It took some PHP programming to get it completely as we wish, but now it works fine and suits my goals well." | "If you do not have someone capable of working behind the scenes, it would be difficult to manage." | "I'd recommend it if and only if you have at least some knowledge web programming (PHP, JavaScript, XML, MySQL, etc.)." | "Not recommended for anyone without some web programming knowledge." | "With the right technical staff, yes I would." | "If you would be a serious user, I can recommend OpenCart, but also I would recommend hiring a developer to make all custom improvements." | "Yes, I would recommend it as a good platform with cheap extensions." | "There is also a large amount of high-quality extensions." | "Tons of plugins, both free to paid."

**Extensions can create bugs**

"When you modify it, it does amazing things but is super-finicky." | "Buying and installing extensions is a bad idea… It's not a plug-and-play procedure." | "As we grew bigger, there have been headaches, mostly to do with third-party extensions clashing with each other."

You are forced to use Stripe."

I would go to edit a product and nothing worked. I'd call customer support and they'd tell me I need to upgrade. This has happened to me twice in three years with them. I'm hoping they get stuck with a class-action suit for fraud." | "iPage is my host for Weebly. Because of this, I don't have access to all of the features Weebly offers." | "… Full access to all of the Weebly features would sort that at once, but iPage (maybe I should change) wants to lock me in for three years and pay the full amount up front!"

"If you read the forums, one problem that continually arises, and one that I have, is bandwidth.

My store doesn't have a huge amount of traffic (yet!), but I still go over my plan just about every month."

"Spark Pay is not simple!" | "They have a ton of features built in -- most of them are half-baked and don't function 100%, which has led to frustration." | "[Needs to] reduce the bloat in their software." | "Unless you have a designer and/or developer on staff, or at the very least a very computer-savvy non-techie, it's virtually impossible to understand Spark Pay." | "Their web editor is clumsy." | "Their platform is buggy." | "It is crazy complicated to make even some of the most mundane changes." | "Their system bogs down so much that only the most minor of changes are doable." | "Clunky UI, way too much complexity. Just a nightmare to deal with."

**While prompt, customer support can be disappointing**

"There service desk really isn't one. They have no formal (or competent) escalation process." | "They are not nearly as responsive to fixing significant issues as they should be." | "I feel like the platform has a lot of tools to offer, but few resources to teach you how to use them." | "Technical support is rather lacking. When you do finally get someone to answer the tickets, they do a very minimal amount of work and effort to correct the problem."

**Customer support**

"Their technical support department people are top-notch… I'm extremely impressed with them." | "The [support] team at Volusion is knowledgeable, and that is highly important." | "Their customer support is excellent." | "Their support is superb." | "Support is second to none." | "There technical support team is also very good in helping to fix any issues that we might have had."

**Bandwidth limitations**

"The one thing I can't stand is the amount of bandwidth they provide you with. [It] will easily be gone in a week if you have a lot of visitors." | "They don't have adequate bandwidth plans, and their billing for bandwidth overages is highly irritating." | "Site traffic is pricey." | "I originally used very large images for my products and received some rather stiff hosting fines for going over the stupidly low bandwidth level." | "The way they charge for bandwidth caused us to have obscene overage charged for months."

**Expensive**

"It is particularly expensive, and the costs weren't clear [when we started]." | "Once the site is built, they nickel and dime you for every little thing imaginable." | "I also used the Volusion SEO team and that was a joke. $1600 a month!" | "Not the least expensive around." | "I would caution new users to be aware of hidden costs. Email addresses are extra. An SSL certificate is extra. A service to check the reliability of each credit card is extra. SEO and design services are phenomenally expensive." | "Going by the prices they charge for SEO packages, they're aiming at companies far larger than mine." | "If you want anything besides barebone offerings, everything else is available… for a price." | "I just wish it was a little cheaper." | "Volusion keeps [the initial setup and customization] complicated, hoping that you will pay them to do it for you."

**Difficult to use**

"The back end is not user-friendly." | "The UX is confusing and bloated, but I'm used to it." | "There is a learning curve, so it takes a while to get going. And if you want customization, be prepared to learn it yourself or pay some hefty fees." | "It's not straightforward and is prone to errors." | "If you change a font size within the text, you then lose all other formatting -- nothing major, but annoying and time-consuming." | "It's quite clunky to manage content and design." | "There are random glitches throughout the site that have probably cost me thousands in abandoned carts." | "One thing that is hard for me is manipulating website elements. GoDaddy was easier for me."

It's worth noting that this is not a list of all e-commerce software currently available in the world. Instead, I've only included software for which I was able to talk to a minimum of 30 users (and I was not able to find 30 users for several companies).

But this is a fairly comprehensive list of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, these are the thoughts of real, verified users. I hope it's helpful in your search for the right e-commerce software!
