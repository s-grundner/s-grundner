# Your About Page Is A Conversion Gold Mine

_Captured: 2015-12-09 at 23:12 from [klientboost.com](https://klientboost.com/cro/about-page-conversion/)_

What are you trying to accomplish with your About Page?

That's an important question to ask for _any_ page on your website, but we typically have an answer for most other pages.

  * Landing page - **Convert**, **convert**, **convert**!
  * Service page - Educate _and_ convert
  * Contact page - Make it easy for the right people to contact you
  * Resource page - Establish brand as topical authority
  * Blog page - Attract and convert inbound traffic

But what about your About Page? What is the purpose?

Anytime I visit a new website and find myself pleased with the content, I immediately click on the About Page to understand what this website is all about.

Is this just _another_ inexperienced guy trying to coerce me into giving him money?

Is this just _another_ mommy blog spouting unbacked opinions on random topics?

Is this just _another_ mediocre service business hoping to reel in the uneducated?

_Or_ is this someone who **actually knows what they're doing**?

Is this a business that has **succeeded** with top-level clients?

Is this site's purpose something **I resonate** with?

The About Page will be your first real introduction to incoming visitors.

Your content is like a screening process, where visitors decide if they are even interested in getting to know you, but once they've clicked on your About Page, they've decided they'd like to meet you and see what you're all about.

What will they find?

Before we talk about what they should find, let's take a moment and discuss what they shouldn't find.

## 2 Things That Should NEVER Exist On An About Page

There are two things I see repeatedly on About Us pages that simply boggle my mind.

**1) Generic Wording**

If there was ever a place to be personable and unique, it's your About Page. Having an About Page is basically a license to have a personality.

You don't need to be crazy. You just need to be you.

Why?

Because YOU are the primary difference between the 300 other businesses that allegedly offer the same thing as you.

Maybe you need your landing pages to be strictly formal and professional. I've worked with a bunch of lawyers. I understand. But there is no reason your About Page needs to read:

"_Captain James T. Kirk has been operating the USS Enterprise for the last 15 years. He has vast experience in starship piloting, deep space discovery and team leadership. Captain Kirk and his industry-leading team can provide quality transportation for all interplanetary commerce within Sector 7_."

Want to know how to make space-themed science fiction boring?

Generic wording.

Write with some personality. At minimum, write like someone is actually going to read it.

You don't need to pretend to be anything. If you have a dry personality, that's okay. Simply write like you are talking to someone who wants to get to know you.

> _Throw in a little bit of personal but also why you're good at what you do._

**2)** **Direct Selling**

Pretty much every spot on your website is a great point for direct selling… except your About Page.

Imagine this:

You're at a party. You're having a fantastic time. You're moderately engaged in a group conversation about the ambiguous acting talent of Nicholas Cage.

Some guy you've never met mentions he once tried to get Cage to endorse his travel agency, and the two of you begin a 1-to-1 conversation about the service industry.

You ask him where's he from, where he's living now and how his career got started.

He answers your questions briefly and then begins pitching you on buying a timeshare.

… worst party ever.

Not awkward enough? How about this:

Your church friend invites you over to dinner. You're pretty excited, because you've been wanting to get to know her family for some time.

You show up. Wait, who are all these other people with similarly confused faces?

And then your friend walks out with a bag of Mary Kay…

The point is, when people are trying to get to know you, it's a REALLY bad time to be selling.

Sell on your landing page. Sell on your service pages. Sell anywhere you like.

**Don't direct-sell on your About Page**.

Yes, you are "selling" yourself via your About Page. You are presenting yourself in a way that makes you an attractive person or business to buy from.

But don't use generic wording, and don't attempt to directly sell via your About Us Page.

## 3 Types of About Pages For 3 Types of Websites

Now that we've covered what not to do, let's look at what we _should_ be doing with our About pages.

I've come across 3 different types of highly compelling About pages, each fitting a different type of owner or business.

Don't feel limited to this archetypes. Your About Page should introduce readers to you, rather than a fabricated persona.

I think, however, you will find key insights from these archetypes that will help you create a meaningful page of your own.

Here are the 3 types of compelling About pages:

1) I'm an expert with a story

2) I'm just like you, on a journey

3) We're a business with values

Let's take a closer look at each one.

### 1) The "Expert With A Story" Approach

One of the best types of About pages is the "expert with a story" page, and there is no better example of this than Neil Patel.

[Neil's About Page ](http://www.quicksprout.com/about/)on his blog QuickSprout is a fascinating case study in establishing expertise and bragging without making people hate you.

![about us page](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-us-600x329.png)

> _Neil starts with showing his expertise then tells his personal story._

After opening with a hand drawn image depicting Neil, the opening paragraph reads:

"_Neil Patel is the co-founder of Crazy Egg, Hello Bar and KISSmetrics. He helps companies like Amazon, NBC, GM, HP and Viacom grow their revenue. _

_The Wall Street Journal calls him a top influencer on the web, Forbes says he is one of the top 10 online marketers, and Entrepreneur Magazine says he created one of the 100 most brilliant companies in the world. _

_He was recognized as a top 100 entrepreneur under the age of 30 by President Obama and one of the top 100 entrepreneurs under the age of 35 by the United Nations. Neil has also been awarded Congressional Recognition from the United States House of Representatives._"

Wow. That was a mouthful. Amazon, NBC, GM, HP, Viacom, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, United Nations, and President Obama.

Name drop much?

This paragraph is a brag and half. The guy's tagline is literally "I'm kind of a big deal", taken straight from the comically narcissistic Ron Burgundy in the movie Anchorman.

But guess what? No one really minds. If you were to happen upon this About Page and read through, you would not in any way get annoyed at this arrogant dude named Neil.

Why is that?

  * It's an About Page. You are supposed to talk about yourself.
  * It's written in the 3rd person (the rest of the page isn't, but the braggiest part is).
  * Neil follows up this paragraph immediately with a sincerely written life story.

Neil starts by **establishing that he is**, in fact, an **expert**. This is important because it immediately makes the reader interested to learn more.

We all want to be experts, so when realize that someone is indisputably an expert, we want to learn how they got there.

If you stop at expertise, you are just an arrogant braggart.

If you become an expert with a story, you are intriguing. Neil's story isn't particularly compelling as far as success stories go. And that's the point.

It's not designed to be turned into a Lifetime movie. It's designed to sell you on the idea that Neil is naturally good at what he does, while creating goodwill in his status as a normal guy - a guy who has identified and capitalized on his gifting and now wants to share that expertise with you.

Step 1. Establish expertise.

Step 2. Tell your story.

Anyone with a level of expertise can do this. Businesses can do this as well.

You don't need to be the best in the world. You don't to have the most compelling story.

You just need to have some level of demonstrable expertise, and you have to be willing to **honestly** tell the story of how you arrived where you are today.

### 2) The "Just Like You" Approach

Another fantastic About Page utilizes the "everyman" appeal. You aren't an expert. You are just like your audience, but perhaps a few steps ahead of them in your journey.

A great example of this is [Pat Flynn's About Page](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/about/) on his blog Smart Passive Income.

![about us page](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-us-page-600x311.png)

> _Pat starts with his personal story to create an instant connection._

Pat is currently making over $100k per month. He is wildly famous in terms of online personalities.

So why does his opening two paragraphs underplay all that?

The reason is that Pat has kept essentially the same "About" message he has had since the beginning, when he was making $5k per month.

If you were to have checked Pat's blog years ago (I did), you would have found basically the same message you will find today.

To summarize: _"I'm a normal guy with a family who is trying to figure out how to make passive income online. I just got laid off from my job as an architect and now I'm trying everything I can to make this online thing work for me. _

_I'm the crash dummy for your success. __Follow along with me as we see what works and what doesn't!"_

The best part is that Pat's income actually reflects this "follow along with me" message. While Neil makes most of his money from his businesses and consultations - what you would expect from an expert - Pat makes over 70% of his revenue via affiliate earnings from products he uses for his online business.

In other words, he makes most of his money from trying something, telling everyone it works and then having it work for them over the long haul.

The "just like you, on a journey" strategy works very well for About pages. It **creates instant connection** with the reader and **starts the relationship** on a foundation of **trust** and **mutual respect**.

Unlike the expert page, it's important to mention but underplay achievements when taking the "just like you" approach.

Bragging will destroy the connection.

As a final note, while this approach is **ideally suited for individuals**, it can work for businesses as well - but only small to mid-sized businesses.

No one is buying the "just like you" approach from a corporation.

### 3) The "Business With Values" Approach

Unlike individual bloggers or small businesses, it's hard for mid to large sized businesses to connect with customers via a personal story.

There's really nothing cute or compelling about the story of a 500-person business (at least most 500-person businesses I've met). It's a business. It makes money. It's paying people to say stuff about it.

And while you probably won't connect with a personal story, you CAN get people to resonate with your company culture.

The best example I've seen of this is Buffer.

![about page values](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-page-values-600x518.png)

> _[about page values](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-page-values.png)_

Buffer has become just as well known for the way they do business as they are for their SaaS offering. They preach **transparency** everywhere they go and the numbers back up their **professed company values**.

When you read Buffer's About Page, or any one of their blog posts not focused on social media marketing, you will immediately see concepts like enjoyable work life, positivity, transparent business operations, and team-first thinking.

Why?

When Buffer makes a big deal about it's core values, anyone who resonates with those values begins paying attention.

Anyone who wishes work was more enjoyable starts paying attention.

Anyone who feels like their employers are a bit shady starts paying attention.

Anyone who resonates with positive thinking starts paying attention.

Buffer is a social media app provider. There is nothing inherently personal, emotional, or meaningful about that reality.

But by becoming a "Business With Values", particular values that aren't business-as-usual, Buffer has made a way for thousands of people to resonate with its vision in a meaningful way.

## About Pages That "Convert"

So what should you include on your unique About Page?

Despite my instruction to avoid selling, your About Page can actually be a big-time converter. Here at KlientBoost, it's the [3rd highest converting page](https://klientboost.com/about-us/) on the site.

![converting about us page](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/converting-about-us-page-600x235.png)

> _3rd highest conversion page?! That's a big opportunity you shouldn't overlook._

Looking at this page and hundreds of other successful About pages, we can see that every About Page should include the following:

1) Vision/Outlook/Mission/Value/Purpose/Identity

2) Personality

3) Credentials

4) CTA

Let's take a look at what I mean.

1) **Communicate your Identity & Purpose**

![about page purpose](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-page-purpose-600x210.png)

> _Communicate your purpose somewhere on your About page._

Some people call it their mission statement. Others call it their core values. Regardless of the name, you should communicate your reason for being there.

2) **Communicate with personality. **

![about page personality](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/about-page-personality-600x267.png)

> _I mean, who wouldn't want to partner up with dog lovers? Especially when holding this cute pup._

As we mentioned before, your About Page should have personality. You don't have to be a comedian. You don't have to be suave. You just have to be you.

3) **Mention your credentials.**

You'll notice in the above image that Johnathan is somewhat humorously being introduced while the copy is making sure to mention his awards and the times his expertise has been called upon by recognizable brands.

Be sure to mention what you are noteworthy on your About Page.

4) **Include a CTA**

![CTA on about us page](https://klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CTA-on-about-us-page-600x258.png)

> _Give them the opportunity to continue a relationship with you._

Don't sell at any point during your About Page. At the end, however, give them an _option_ to continue their relationship with you by including a non-sales-y CTA.

## Conclusion

Whatever approach you take, **don't waste your About Page**. It's far more important than the marketing attention it receives might suggest.

The purpose of the About Page is to introduce people to your business.

It's to make a meaningful connection. It's to start a relationship.

As we conclude, I'd like to clarify that your About Page isn't enough to be seen as an "Expert With A Story", a "Just Like You" guide, or a "Business With Value". You have to back that approach up in everything you do.

For Neil, that looks like kicking ass with international brands, sharing the results, and giving away free resources.

For Pat, that looks like constantly experimenting and doing it with humility, class, and a complete lack of condescension.

For Buffer, that looks like open salaries and very personal, very transparent blog posts from its founders.

Now, it's your turn. How can you improve your About Page to better connect with new viewers?
