> _Compared to CM(conf mgmt) tools, docker is more popular now. Yes, I know._

Among CM tools, Ansible is more popular now. Yes, I know.

But lots of companies are still using Chef.

It took me quite a while to get comfortable with Chef, so why not export my Chef experience in a good way.

A "good way?" What does that mean?

  1. No bullshit. No buzz words. No overwhelming info.
  2. Everything is on GitHub. Totally free and open.
  3. Real scenarios and real requirements. Try to avoid fake ones.
  4. Step-by-step, scenario-by-scenario. Yes, so-called from dummies to pros.
