science projects - science experiments - science fair project ideas

## We wish to show you how can a small simple electric generator can be created, which can be used for educational purpose to help the teachers to explain how electricity is created and how it works.

## How it works the simple generator described below ?

The rotating magnetic field induces an ac voltage in the stator windings (coil ). The rotor's magnetic field is produced by the neodymium magnet sphere. The permanent magnet field is constant and the terminal voltage varies directly with the speed of the dc motor. This is an AC electric generator which lights up led bulbs 7 W 230 V. The generator is composed of a coil without core - copper wires, a magnet (neodymium sphere) , a small dc motor, a metal screw pot case, a plastic holder and a battery.

Electric generators are devices which are using alternating magnetic fields to create a current through a wire circuit ( alternating current) AC. An electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by generating voltage (EMF) that forces electrons to flow in an electric circuit. This is called electromagnetic induction.

## How to make a simple generator (simple model generator)

Step 1. Materials:

1.** 3V Dc motor** - inside toys which using two batteries 1.5 V AA - simple generator component

> _3 V Dc motor_

2\. **coil without core** inside syncronous motor 230 V - A4 laminators, microwave turntable motor - simple generator component

> _plastic connector inside toy car_

remove the plastic connector from the toy car case

6\. **plastic and metal components from mechanical construction kit** - used to build the holder for dc motor and coil - simple generator holder

7.** 3.7 V battery 600 mAh or a related battery**

8\. **230 V led bulb 3W - 7 W + E 27 socket 230 V **

9\. **power switch + wires**

1\. Remove the magnet from the neodymium screw pot metal case

2\. Remove the coil from the syncronous motor

3\. Attach the screw pot metal case to the dc motor ax through the plastic connector

4\. Create the simple generator holder

5\. Conect the wires to the dc motor and battery through the power switch.

6\. Conect the bulbs using the wires to the coil output ( in Ac current it doesn't matter the conection order, only in dc is very important), connect the bulbs in parallel.

**this science project is not for childs. It is only for teachers and people with knowledges in the electric field.**

### Important!

the position neodymium magnet sphere 12.7 mm - screw pot metal case (magnetic catch ) between magnetic poles (N and S)

![electric generator neodymium sphere](http://sciencetoolbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/position-neodymyum-sphere-metal-case.jpg)

> _position : neodymium sphere 12.7 mm - metal case screw pot 12.7 mm_

Do not use magnetic materials (screws , etc ) for the simple generator holder near the neodymium sphere - it will act like a magnetic brake for the sphere.

using diferent dc motors, coils, neodymium magnet spheres, dc motors and batteries we obtained diferent results - we tested only small components to keep the educational purpose.

tested bulbs : 3 W - 9W 230 V

We are looking forward to improve the small generator educational purpose.
