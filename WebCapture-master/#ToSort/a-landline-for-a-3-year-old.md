# A Landline for a 3-Year-Old

In our modern world, it's easier than ever to get in touch with someone at any time. Just call, text, message, or video chat with that person on his or her smartphone. This works great for adults, but what about kids that are a little too young to understand how this works -- or even have their own phones -- and just need to be able to call mom or dad? It's not an easy question to answer, but this hacker came up with a great solution, a pseudo-landline using a [Raspberry Pi](http://hackster.io/raspberry-pi) for communication.

The phone's receiver is custom-made out of MDF, and inside of it a carefully aligned bolt pushes down a switch when the handset is "on the hook," telling the Pi that the system is inactive.

When Junior decides to make a call, the bolt/switch pops up, and two arcade style buttons blink to show him his limited options. The Raspberry Pi then calls mom or dad via a Google Voice account, meaning that there's no additional monthly charge, and that the wrong number won't be dialed.

It's a very neat setup both electronics and woodworing-wise. If you'd like to create your own, or perhaps even an expanded device with more numbers, [check out the build process here](https://imgur.com/r/DIY/9rM1k)!
