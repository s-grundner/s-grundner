Today we'd like to share a couple of ideas for search interaction effects with you. Mainly, we'd like to provide you with some inspiration for how to show the search interface in an interesting way. Maybe you've seen some modern animations for showing the search already, like [Swiss Army Man](http://swissarmyman.com/) or [CMMNTY](https://cmmnty.co/). Today we want to explore some different layouts combined with some engaging CSS animations.

**Attention:** The demos serve only as proof-of-concepts and inspirational ideas for UI interactions. Made with modern CSS properties; for fierce browsers only.

The demos all have a schematic look and almost all of them show the search interface when clicking on the search icon that is always placed in the top right corner of the page (except for demo 2 where the search UI alters with an animation once the input is focused).

## Example Search UI Effects

Have a look at some of the final states of the opened search UIs:
