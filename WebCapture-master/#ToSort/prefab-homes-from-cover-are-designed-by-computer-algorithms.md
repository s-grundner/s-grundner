If you're in the market for a prefab dwelling--either as a [full-time home](http://www.curbed.com/2015/6/19/9948178/affordable-prefab-homes-buy) or [backyard unit](http://www.curbed.com/2016/8/4/12370586/prefab-homes-sheds-backyard-office-studio)--[options](http://www.curbed.com/2017/2/10/14576528/prefab-homes-modern-shipping-container-honomobo) [are](http://www.curbed.com/2017/2/20/14670478/prefab-homes-modern-design-for-sale-coodo) [aplenty](http://www.curbed.com/2016/12/19/14009528/prefab-homes-designs-prices). What L.A.-based startup [Cover](http://cover.build/) wants to add to the equation is a tech-driven efficiency that makes the whole design and building process a total breeze for the customer.

As detailed in a new profile on the company over on [Co.Design](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90108816/this-company-designs-custom-homes-for-less-than-an-iphone?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=codesigndaily-top&position=2&partner=newsletter&campaign_date=04062017), Cover sees itself as more of a tech company than a prefab builder. Indeed, whereas a typical prefab buying process would begin with choosing one of a few model plans and maybe then consulting with architects to tweak the design for specific needs, Cover turns the whole design process over to computer algorithms. Co.Design explains:

> Once customers begin the design process, Cover sends them a survey of about 50 to 100 questions to inform the design. It asks about lifestyle-how many people typically cook a meal and what appliances are must-haves?-and structural needs, like should they optimize one view and block another one? 

The company also use computer modeling to optimize window placement, cross-ventilation, and natural light, making use of zoning, sun-path, and geospatial data. All of these parameters are then sent to a proprietary computer program that spits out hundreds of designs that satisfy the requirements supplied.

Here are a couple of key things to know about Cover's prefabs:

  * The company is specializing in the [accessory dwelling unit](https://accessorydwellings.org/what-adus-are-and-why-people-build-them/), which is a secondary structure on a property with an existing single-family house. They can serve as guesthouses, in-law units, offices, yoga studios, and potentially a source of rental income. 
  * While the computer will churn out a whole bunch of designs, Cover dwellings generally have a minimal modern look with an insulated steel structure, glass walls, and built-in storage. 
  * When you order with Cover, the company takes care of the whole process, from coming up with a design, as described above (which takes three business days and $250), to acquiring necessary permits (two to five months, $20,000), to building and installation (12 weeks, final price contingent on the specific design). Some sample costs offered on the website are as follows: $70,000 for a guest room, $130,000 for a studio with a kitchenette, $160,000 for a one-bedroom unit, and $250,000 for a two-bedroom unit.
