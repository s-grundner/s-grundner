_**PART 1: GETTING STARTED:**_

  * Look at the program below and run it, what does it do?
  * Do you see that the **forward(100) **moves the turtle forward and draws a line. The **left(90) **turns the turtle left 90 degrees. 
  * _How do you think you turn it right 45 degrees?_
  * Using these lines of code create a Square, adding your code from line 12
  * Can you create a Triangle? think about the angles.....

_**PART 3: CREATING SHAPES:**_

  * The turtle has some pre-created shapes that can be easily drawn by their name.
  * The code used is **draw_square(tommy, "red", 100, -100, -75) **where the first 100 represents the size of the shape. The middle number is the x position left or right where the turtle starts to draw from. The last number is the y position up or down.
  * From line 11 onward, create a white circle
  * Create a blue triangle (Illuminati confirmed!)
  * Create a yellow star

_**CHALLENGE 2: DECORATE THE CHRISTMAS TREE:**_

  * Santa's Elves have been busy wrapping presents but have forgotten to sort the Christmas tree. They have create a program to do it, but it needs finishing.
  * Add code from line 13 onward to finish the Christmas tree
  * Add a pot for the tree if you want a challenge!
