## A web-app with new optimizations for your SVG files--especially those exported from Sketch.

Today I'm releasing a free little web-app for optimizing ("cleaning up") SVG files. It's called [SVGito](http://sketchmaster.com/svgito).

If the idea of SVG code or optimization is new to you, take a moment to read this other article explaining [how to think about SVG](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-designers-should-think-about-svg-b2b92efc4d77).

As its name suggests*****, **SVGito is a small tool**. It helps designers and developers by automating a few improvements to SVGs that you would normally have to do by manually editing the code. These improvements typically reduce an SVG's complexity and file size, while retaining the same visual appearance.

Today SVGito is launching with just a few optimizations (listed below). Most of these cannot be found in other SVG optimizers, and more optimizations will come in the future. What you see today is a starting point; a foundation.

> Using it is simple: you paste your SVG code, SVGito quickly runs optimizations on it, then you copy the resulting code.
