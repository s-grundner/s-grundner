Over the years, experts have observed a significant change in the traditional 9-to-5 workday to the point of saying that the eight hour grind may soon be an exception instead of a rule. According to the communications firm Euro RSCG Worldwide, one of the top 12 trends for 2012 was that employees of the Generation Y or Millennial demographic are overruling the traditional workday.

It shouldn't have come as a surprise to the world that millennials are starting to take over the current workforce. As of writing, the overall Asian workforce is being dominated by this new wave of people at an estimated 48% -- ranging from ages 15 to 34. The current Philippine workforce is closely following this trend at 44%. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics even predicts that by the 2030, the said demographic will make up 75% of the workforce.

Known for being tech-savy, creative, and independent, Millennials are one of the strongest driving force behind the arising changes in the workplace. Despite the bad reputation and stereotypes this young generation seemed to be getting for challenging the conventional way of working, they probably have a logical reason for not wanting to chain themselves to a desk.

## The Change: Shifting Away From Desk Jobs

The generation of young professionals today value autonomy and independence in the workplace, unlike their parents that valued the security of 9-5 desk jobs.

Millennials are risk takers who are not scared of switching from one job to another - a complete contrast to those coming from the older generation who held their jobs with a tight grip. According to the 2016 Deloitte Millennial Survey, one in four Millennials would quit their current jobs to join a new organization or do something different - if given the choice. The said figure increases up to 44 percent when the given time frame is expanded two years. And by the end of the year 2020, two out of every three respondents hope to have moved on from their current employers. This seemingly lack of loyalty may be fueled by the wants of the employees to continuously develop their skills and to remain happy. This generation won't give changing jobs any second thoughts if this change would give them greater opportunities.

Another study have said that 37% of Gen Y workers would rather have their pay cut if it meant more flexibility - a balance between work and play. Studies have also said that flexible working have positively affected their productivity and loyalty to their company.

Almost all employees coming from different demographic share this desire for flexibility, but none more than Millennials. This generation tend to prioritize work satisfaction and out-of-work happiness than earning the most money. Though often seen as laziness, Millennials are known to have 50-60 work weeks and this includes evenings and weekends.

With a more flexible work hours, you have a greater chance of spending time on leisure and loved ones. A person's mental and physical health can greatly affect their work ethic and happiness. Older generations may have made it look like it is something hard to achieve but Generation Y are living proof that a high quality of life is possible.

The increasing demand for a more flexible work hours and office environment paved way to opportunities for a new kind of office space: Coworking Spaces - one of the latest trends in the business industry.

**Coworking spaces** are membership-based workplaces that offer a more comfortable work area for the freelancers and entrepreneurs of this generation. Not only will they be providing an affordable workplace with a guaranteed smooth sailing business operation, it will also give you a change of scenery. It suggests that the combination of a healthier work environment and a great work experience can become part of a company's strategy in creating a happier atmosphere in the office that will not only help your employees improve their productivity but also benefit your business to thrive.

_"Don't chain yourself to a desk!"_

The ideals that Generation Y have may be unconventional but the rest of the world should give them credit for the innovation they have brought upon. And with majority of today's workforce coming from this demographic, are you ready for them? Talk to us on how you can catch up on the trend of flexible working hours.
