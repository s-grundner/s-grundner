The company I co-founded, Wannabiz, is now ~5 years old and has gone through significant changes in technology and platforms. The first phase of the product, an application for small businesses to do Social and Web marketing, was developed in 2011, and was focused on the Web as the main platform, it offered a rich set of features, based on web technology residing on AWS infrastructure, using mostly open source stack - Apache, Linux, PHP, MongoDB, Java.

At the time it was kind of a fixation we had, that professionals or work related applications are best served in the form of a web application, that people will do most of the work via a desktop PC and a browser. We had many users, and the application worked as expected.

Working in this mode had several great advantages: it was very Agile, we implemented continuous integration methodology and new features, changes were deployed on the production environment as needed, and our product team could come up with great new features that were implemented and deployed in short cycles.

Around 2012 we realized that we are missing a large audience by not approaching Mobile users. At that point, we started implementing our first iOS mobile application. The application was developed in the Standard iOS manner, meaning, with a fixed set of pre-built views, and a somewhat flexible MVC model in which the server controls the flow of the users as they go about a specific task and the general application flow. However, if a new feature is introduced that needs new views that are still not present in the app version, there is a need for an app update. This gave our product team some level of flexibility to easily introduce new features, as long as they used existing views in the app. When we introduced our app on the mobile store, it was a great success, and soon we realized we needed to focus completely on the Mobile path and actually leave aside the web version, as the mobile app had much better adoption and usage numbers. The application was designed with the notion that mobile users have short intermittent sessions with the application, therefore, it needs to be suitable, and actions need to take no longer than one minute to complete. We invested a lot in being able to allow the users to complete their activities in less than a minute. This was done by doing a lot of work on the server-side, giving the users an Artificial Intelligence (AI) module, that helped them make the choice of "what is the right thing for me to do right now," as well as a smart content engine that matches content to specific tasks (like "Share a professional video") and field of operation ("Construction").

Our AI framework is built on top of a ranking algorithm that is learning and producing the optimal results based on Current user states on the web, past user activity, and their success, within the industry and across the industry, and statistics and measurements on top of a large collection of data. We called this piece - BOSME.

At that point, the biggest issue with the Application was its limited flexibility. The static app needed frequent updates to be able to run new features, and new features were developed constantly.

The next phase of the application was planned for Android first, as there was an iPhone app but no Android version yet. After a lot of thinking and examination of the tools and solutions available around 2013, the viable solution that could deliver the level of business flexibility that we needed was to develop a "SaaS Mobile App," an application that was merely the visual layer of the MVC model, rendering the applications views, according to instructions coming from the server. This is somewhat similar in concept to a web browser, which is receiving HTML and rendering the view on the client side.

The Wannabiz mobile app generated a "native" experience on the client side, according to instructions provided by the server. We developed an UI and event framework on the client side, and a language, based on JSON, that included layout and component information, as well as data and event handling instructions. This way, we could release new features and change existing features and flows, without having to do frequent application updates. That served our business purposes well, as we could create a stream of new capabilities to the product just like it was a web application, taking the Continuous Integration and Delivery all the way into the mobile app.

The next step was to implement the same engine on iOS, and then the same server controlled application can run seamlessly on Android and IOS. At the time we considered React Native and AngularJS as the basis for this engine, but both were not mature enough to provide all the functionality we needed. Today it would be much more sensible to do this work based on an existing framework or platform as they are much more mature.

Today, Wannabiz is releasing new features with little development effort, almost entirely by an operation team who utilizes the Content Platform, The AI framework, and the SaaS engine to bring highly relevant and up to date experiences and capabilities to our customers. The platform is delivering B2B, B2C, and B2B2C products with zero coding. Now it's all about the business, we achieved and exceeded the technological goals we set for ourselves.
