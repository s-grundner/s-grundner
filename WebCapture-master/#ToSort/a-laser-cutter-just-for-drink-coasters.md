When you go to a restaurant or drinking establishment, you expect to receive a coaster to put under your glass. While they may have interesting logos or pictures on them, you likely pay them little attention. One thing to note though is that the square coasters all come in the same square shape.

Hacker Bart Dring noticed this dimensional consistency himself, and decided that this would make it perfect for automation, coming up with a portable laser coaster [customizer that he calls "Coasty."](http://www.buildlog.net/blog/2017/11/coasty-version-1-1/) This device, as shown in the video below, "eats" a coaster that you slide into a slot on the front, then manipulates it with a roller and laser cutter/engraver until it spits out your own customized design.

If this looks pretty neat and you'd like to build your own, Dring is selling the [controllers for it here](https://www.tindie.com/products/11013). Of course you'll need to provide your own chassis and laser unit, however, it would give you a huge head start on building your own.
