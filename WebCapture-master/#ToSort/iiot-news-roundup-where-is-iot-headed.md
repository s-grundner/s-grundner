The holiday season is fast-approaching and it seems there's always a never-ending list of tasks that need to be completed every year. Just like the holiday checklist, tech in the IIoT space seems to be ever-changing and expanding. As tech leaders and innovators we understand that life is hectic and unpredictable, but to make sure you don't miss a beat, check out this week's line-up for news in the IoT industry. Previously, we explored "[How IoT is Saving Lives](http://www.freewave.com/iiot-news-roundup-iot-saving-lives/)" when two massive natural disasters struck the U.S.

In this post, we'll ask the question, what's next for the world of IoT/IIoT?

Take a look at some of the top stories from the past couple of weeks:

## **Forrester Predicts What's Next for IoT**

In this [recent post ](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3237268/internet-of-things/forrester-predicts-what-s-next-for-iot.html)from [@NetworkWorld](https://twitter.com/NetworkWorld) about Forrester Research's [predictions post](https://www.forrester.com/report/Predictions+2018+IoT+Moves+From+Experimentation+To+Business+Scale/-/E-RES139752), Fredric Paul, [@TheFreditor](https://twitter.com/TheFreditor), asks the question on many people's minds: Where is IoT headed? Among many points Paul makes in his article, one points out how IoT is likely to become more specialized in the coming year, moving away from generic hardware and software into platforms designed for specific industries. So-called "design and operate scenarios" will let IoT developers focus on the attributes that matter most to their own industries and use cases.

## **Smart Networks Must Evolve for Mission-Critical Environments**

From [@embedded_comp](https://twitter.com/embedded_comp/status/921064926998700034), Michael Ulch explains [how the IoT industry](http://www.embedded-computing.com/industrial/smart-networks-must-evolve-for-mission-critical-environments) has been flooded with advances in smart home automation, self-monitoring appliances, and connected security systems. All of these facets are important for the IoT existence but Ulch asks the same question as other reporters: what is next for IoT? Ulch believes that some of the greatest potential of the IoT is in the industrial and manufacturing realm, where Industrial IoT (IIoT) has the promise to monitor systems for preventative maintenance and boost energy efficiency and workplace productivity.

However, Ulch says, successfully scaling from the smart home to the smart factory will require overcoming a number of technical challenges.

## **How Manufacturers Are Benefitting From the IoT Revolution**

In this [@NetworkWorld](https://twitter.com/NetworkWorld) article by Majid Ahmed, [it's made clear](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3237464/manufacturing/how-manufacturers-are-benefitting-from-the-iot-revolution.html) that few people stand to benefit more from the IoT revolution than today's manufacturers. Ahmed states in his article that whether it's harnessing the power of data and metadata to make wiser decisions, or developing new and more efficient technologies capable of saving energy cost, the IoT is fundamentally reshaping how manufacturers produce the goods we use in our everyday lives.

## **Businesses Not Aware of IoT Issues**

[This article](http://www.techradar.com/news/businesses-not-aware-of-iot-issue) from [@techradar](http://www.techradar.com/) by [@maxcooter ](https://twitter.com/maxcooter) briefly starts off by referencing an article from January, [10 surprising trends in the IoT for 2017](http://www.techradar.com/news/10-surprising-trends-in-the-iot-for-2017), then Cooter continues, stating that Cradlepoint survey finds lots of interest in technology deployment but lack of security awareness.

Cooter points out that, from these findings, IoT-using companies should be prepared to have a thorough overhaul of its infrastructure before deploying the technology. Despite the serious concerns about security, most are not having a second thought about rolling out IoT. Will this security breach take down most companies? Time will tell.

## **The Industrial Internet of Things Is Here to Stay**

In [this article](https://www.cbronline.com/4th-revolution/industrial-internet-things-stay/) from [@cbronline](https://twitter.com/cbronline) (Computer Business Review), author David Stain discusses how manufacturers are welcoming in a new era of productivity by enhancing Industry 4.0. The IIoT is at the heart of this transformation. Stain explores how a company's success is often linked to its efficiency, hence visibility, across the plant floor, and how extending into the supply chain is a necessity. To keep pace with this competitive environment and the ever-increasing customer demands, every stage of the manufacturing process is facing the digital revolution.

## **Final Thoughts**

Virtually all industries and workers are benefitting from the technological revolution brought about by the inception and ensuring the growth of IoT. Every industry does need to be cautious of the security threats that IoT comes with. Knowing this, we will still continue to see the growth for IoT especially in the manufacturing and Industrial industries.
