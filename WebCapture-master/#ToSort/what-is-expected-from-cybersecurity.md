### Since cybersecurity is paramount in our world, but not all of us are experts, or have the money to hire one, here's some tips on how to pick a security software package.

Cybersecurity is more than just a line of defense against criminals creating clone social media accounts.

When you consider that cybercrime is going to cost an [estimated $2 trillion by 2019](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2016/01/17/cyber-crime-costs-projected-to-reach-2-trillion-by-2019/#5ee44f673bb0), it's clear that cybersecurity is one of the most important investments that every company, small business, and, possibly, every one of us should be making.

However, most of us don't really understand the intricacies of this fast-moving industry. So, what exactly should we expect from cybersecurity?

## **Significant Protection**

As technology develops and more people gain an understanding of the coding magic that defines our world, increasing numbers of cybercriminals are born.

A few years ago, very few people had the hacking skills necessary to break through the simple protection safeguards in place online and embedded in software. However, we're creating a generation of software coders who find it simple to penetrate the preventative measures that cybersecurity firms have in place - partly because you can [buy hacking software "out of the box."](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3168389/security/rise-of-as-a-service-lowers-bar-for-cybercriminals.html)

The primary expectation of any cybersecurity system is to protect against infiltration of any kind, whether it's a plug-and-play password cipher or a sophisticated network virus.

Simply put, companies should demand security that can keep up and keep the bad guys out.

## **Simple Integration**

The problem with demanding up-to-date cybersecurity measures is that we don't want them to interfere with our daily lives. Running constant updates, entering complex passwords, and reducing the use of peripherals and specific websites is irritating. An irritated employee is far less likely to take the precautions put in place seriously - they couldn't care because the security makes it impossible for them to do their job.

The ideal cybersecurity solution is felt, but it's not a hindrance. It's like a bodyguard who only appears when you need protection.

## **Affordability**

Cybersecurity suppliers and developers understand there is set to be an unprecedented demand for their products, and that means that they are charging what they like to protect your sensitive information.

However, as with any industry, the gold rush will dry up as companies start offering competitive prices. Companies are looking to bolster their IT support teams with cybersecurity skills, investing in outsourced data protection, and generally cutting costs without increasing their risk. In the world of cybersecurity, value for money goes a long way.

This makes sense, as often there is a need to protect multiple data points against a variety of potential attacks. Paying top dollar for every variable simply isn't financially viable. Cost is an essential part of the cybersecurity equation.

## **A Reassuring Reputation**

It seems like yesterday that Norton, McAfee, and AVG were the only players in the cybersecurity game, but that's changed.

[The forerunners](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemorgan/2016/04/20/meet-the-worlds-largest-pure-play-cybersecurity-companies/#39270b09f9b3) in this multi-billion-dollar industry are not necessarily household names, but they have achieved their status by building a reputation for impenetrable cyber protection measures.

Like so many tech companies, your IT team will probably be able to point you in the direction of a cybersecurity service you can trust, but make sure you do your homework to make sure you're working with the very best.

## **Beyond Protection**

Cybersecurity is much more than simply diffusing threatening software. It encompasses a whole universe of data protection, disaster recovery, staff training, and device security. While you do still find niche operations who focus solely on one part of the cybersecurity pie, you get better value and coverage from the company that sells you a holistic service. If you're in the market, make sure to add 24/7 support to your list of requirements. Cyber-attacks happen at all hours, and you don't want to be forced to try and solve the problem by yourself.

## **A Dynamic Product**

The passwords and firewalls that keep your prized data safe today may very well be rendered useless by an inventive virus tomorrow. Granted, security software cannot adapt to new threats overnight, but you should receive regular updates - and not all of them at an extra cost.

The criminals [change their approach daily](http://www.information-age.com/10-cyber-security-trends-look-2017-123463680/), and your security needs to stay flexible to keep up.

## **Realistic Demands**

Even the best cybersecurity can be beaten. Be realistic in your expectations, build a bundled solution that works for you, and invest in the most thorough protection that you can get - now that you know what to look for.
