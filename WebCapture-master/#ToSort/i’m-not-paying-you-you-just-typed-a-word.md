This week, [Bryce](https://twitter.com/BryceBladon) answers common (and not so common) questions about transitioning from a traditional full-time job to freelancing.

**Freelance FAQ: How do I transition from the 9 to 5 to freelancing?**

Before you make the full-time freelancing plunge…

**Know your finances**

  * Have 3-6 months of savings before you commit

**Start moonlighting**

  * Freedom to learn and experiment.

**When you do start freelancing…**

  1. Communicate with clients (but don't create unnecessary work for them)
  2. Meet deadlines
  3. Always give your best work (if you can)

**Research how freelance taxes work in your state**

**Look into insurance options**

**Create a schedule, system or process for work.**

  * Occasionally re-evaluate what is and isn't working. In particular, look for time investments that aren't showing any returns

**Always evaluate your work/life balance**

**Evaluate your income to expenses**

**Feedback from the Inferno: My boss won't let me have a sidegig - what should I do?**

(This segment originally premiered over at [The Freelancers Union.](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.freelancersunion.org%2F2016%2F08%2F29%2Fsidegigsbad%2F&t=NTAzOGRjZjkyYmU1ZGQxMWVlZjk3YWQ5ZWVjNTg4YzMwOTkxMDNlMSxJdjBub3BNZA%3D%3D&b=t%3AO8vKYEtVOCvpbRVBY_IF2Q&p=http%3A%2F%2Fclientsfromhell.net%2Fpost%2F156395050748%2Ffull-time-to-freelance-and-dealing-with-a&m=0))

_**I moonlight as a freelancer and I know my boss will have a problem with it if he ever finds out. What should I do?**_

_I have done_ freelance _writing here and there for almost 10 years. I enjoy doing it, and I want to really get serious about it._

_Here's my problem: I work full-time as an administrative assistant at a law firm, and my boss is not at all supportive of me doing anything that he thinks might take me away from my job. And let's be honest, he has a point - I do intend to leave when I've got my freelancing off the ground. For now, I need the money, and it's not a terrible gig, but it isn't where my heart is._

_I already have one client that I got by word of mouth, and I know I need to advertise my services to gain more clients - which is scary enough, as I am an introvert - but I'm scared to put myself out there lest my boss discovers what I'm up to and uses it against me._

_I would love just to be honest with him, as I have with my office manager, but past experiences have already taught me that's not an option; as examples, he fired another assistant partly because that assistant divulged that he was going to night school to become an EMT; he also was wary of me getting my CAP-OM certification until I described how it would benefit HIM._

_I already dropped hints_ a long _time ago that I really wanted to pursue writing, but that was dismissed and never referenced again._

_Many others within the firm have_ ventures _outside of the office, including my boss and all of the partners. But for them, the firm is an anchor. For me, it is a stepping stone._

_My question is twofold: is there a way for me to advertise myself stealthily so that I can get clients without my current boss finding out? Or, in the event I just say screw it and put myself out there, how can I prepare to deal with the fallout?_

_I appreciate any help you can give - I am reaching out to you because I have heard you say to start freelancing part-time before jumping in with both feet, and I figured maybe you'd have some insight into a situation like mine._

_I'm tired of holding back and missing out on clients and money because I'm afraid a simple Google search will cost me my job before I'm ready to leave._

- A moonlighter on a mission

First of all, this is easily one of the best-written emails I've ever received. You clearly have the chops to make it on your own as a freelance writer.

Second, your boss is an absolute douche.

With that out of the way…

**Finding Work**

There are tons of ways to market yourself without actually exposing yourself. In nearly a decade of freelancing, roughly 80% of my work came from clients I never actually met.

Word of mouth, job boards, local meetups - they're all great ways to find work when you're first starting out. For your first few jobs, simply letting the world know (via twitter, facebook, etc.) you're available for work is a great way to secure some warm leads.

However, that last bit of advice tickles your main issue…

**On being googled**

I almost always suggest a freelancer use their name as their business, and I think this should still be the case for you. I understand the fear of Googling - and it's a valid concern - but the idea of this boss owning your name online is utterly ridiculous. Plus, your freelance site doesn't need to be salesy or revealing. Giselle's illustration website is a great example of this.

To address this potential name issue, maybe you can focus on your first or last name to start. Remember, most of your potential clients will be directed to your website through you; very few clients will find you by googling "freelance writer" or whatever.

Preparing to go full-time (AKA dealing with the fallout)  
Simply put, I recommend 3-6 months of savings for ALL your living expenses is set aside before you make the full-time freelancing leap.

I also recommend at least three positive client experiences before you make the plunge. Ideally, some of these clients will offer recurring work.

**Other resources**

Here are two articles I always recommend for this stuff:

  * Also, if you ever want to use my [ Start Freelancing course](http://school.clientsfromhell.net/courses/start-freelancing?product_id=91249&coupon_code=FORMYFRIEND) to get a boost, I included a 75% off coupon in that link.

_I'm a freelance graphic designer and I was commissioned to do a selection of designs including a logo, a poster and t-shirt and a video trailer for this event promotion project. _

**Client :** We want the t-shirt with the logo on it.

**Me:** Okay can you send me the full resolution logo file over?

**Client :** No, no, we'd like you to make the logo.

**Me :** That's fine, I can add that to the quote.

_I send them off the estimation, they ask for me to cut the video as it'll be too expensive for them. I remove it and send it back with all the elements minus the video. _

**Me :** Is this okay? If it is I'll draw up the contract.

**Client :** Yes that's fine!

_They sign the contract, pay the deposit and I begin on the logo first as it's going to be used throughout the other designs. _

**Me :** For the logo design, it might be worth chatting to [original event hosting company] to see if they would want to reuse it for other future events, if so then it would cost a bit extra for an [extended license](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/141198368083/client-that-looks-amazing-can-i-get-the-files) which they might be willing to put up some money for.

**Client : **Oh! We didn't want a logo. We were just using that as an example.

_Having already spent several hours on the logo, I was pretty annoyed. Especially since "Logo Design" was clearly marked on BOTH invoices and contract they agreed to._

_I added the wasted hours to the final invoice._

_I'm the owner of a print shop. 99% of the time we do the artwork for our customers. We always ask 1-3 business days to provide a proof for approval, depending on the complexity of the artwork._

_One client placed an order of business cards for his beauty salon at 4pm, on a Tuesday. The next morning, just over 15 hours later, I got this email. _

**Client: **I want my design proof now, or I'll [call the police](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/111956623185/i-would-like-you-to-write-me-an-article-please).

_I called him back._

**Me: **I'm sorry, sir, but there appears to be a misunderstanding. We reserve up to three days to provide proofs for original designs - if you look at our ads, it's specified there.

**Client: **(with COLD FURY) I want my design proof now, or I will call the police.

_I thought a bit about what to do. Ultimately I decided that I would cancel the order and refund his money._

_However, I specified that someone else should pick up his refund, because if I saw him in our office I would "CALL THE POLICE."_

_He sent someone the following week._

_Client approached me for new website copy, complaining that the people who wrote their previous copy didn't really nail the voice. I made sure to ask very specific questions about what they didn't like and why, and wrote a brand guide for them before writing the website so I could be sure I was on the right track._

_The whole torturous process has been studded with moments like this:_

**Me:** So how would you describe the voice of your brand?

**Client:** It needs to be witty and urbane. Funny. But no actual jokes.

--

**Me:** Here is your conversion-optimized website copy, with a full explanation of why I included certain pieces or phrased things a certain way. All of this is based on the research I did about your market. Please give me your feedback by adding comments instead of editing or rewriting the copy.

**Client:** (goes through every single page and rewrites it)

--

**Me:** We really want to keep the site copy about your visitors and what you can do for them, and less about you.

**Client:** Can you just replace [this piece, this piece, this piece, and that piece] with my copy, so they really know who I am?

--

**Me:** I've edited this piece down, as you requested, and would advise making it even shorter so it doesn't look weird with the current site design.

**Client:** Put back in everything you edited out. Also, add this paragraph.

--

**Client:** Can we say "fabulously roomy" here?

**Me:** Yes.

_During next round of edits:_

**Client:** I'm not in love with "fabulously roomy".

_Pardon me while I drown myself in a [bathtub of full of vodka](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/134986014001/can-you-make-my-website-be-the-first-search-result)._

_I was hired to do branding and a website for a non profit. After working together for over two months, the client loved everything I did and was thrilled all along the way. Unfortunately, she was a bit indecisive so it took a lot longer than expected because I kept having to make and revert changes for her. _

**Me: **Just to let you know, we're getting pretty close to my hour cap for this project. I'm more than willing to do the work, but once we go over that I will have to start charging you additionally by the hour.

**Client: **That's no problem! Do what you have to.

_I reminded her of this several times, and let her know what kind of hours I as putting in. She gave the okay, every time._

**Client: **It's incredible, thank you so much! We really love everything you've done and we are so excited.

_She even cried at how much she loved it. _

_Then I sent her the bill._

**Client:** Please send me the final files ASAP. Also, I'm really sorry but I am not going to be able to pay you the extra $1,000 that I owe you.

**Me:** I cannot send the final files until you pay your bill.

**Client:** I am not happy with the[ final branding](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/49199196569/at-the-last-phase-of-a-brand-identity-project) and would like all my money back.

_The best part? I am a female designer and this is a non profit who's mission is to help women who have been taken advantage of._

_I responded to an ad online for an illustrator, They had supplied some sample art and I thought I was the perfect match because I had done very similar work in the past. I contacted the client and sent a link to my portfolio._

**Client:** Looks nice, but I am not sure it would fit our project - we're are looking for a CG artist.

**Me:** Oh! I actually do produce all my art digitally. Do you mean you're looking for a [modeler/3D render artist then](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/135503838890/i-went-to-school-for-vfx-my-class-worked-with-a)? I was under the impression it was a 2D project.

**Client:** Yes it is. CG means computer graphics, it doesn't have to mean 3D. How do you not know that?

**Me:** I do know that - but a lot of people misuse it to mean 3D modelling. When you thought I didn't fit your project I thought that's what you meant.

**Client: **I can't believe you - a digital artist - don't know what CG actually means!

_He then sent me a link to one of those "let-me-google-that-for-you" engines._

_Nope. Thanked them for their time and dropped contact._

  


**Client:** I noticed on your last invoice to me that you c[harged me a late fee](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/1471785356/avoiding-late-fees-at-all-costs)…

**Me:** Yes, as stated in our contract (_which he very clearly didn't read_), a small late fee is applied to the next invoice if the payment is not received by the due date

_His fee was $10 for a +$1000 bill. I gave him lots of reminders beforehand AND I agreed to give his company double the time to pay than all my other clients._

**Client:** I thought we had a better relationship than that, why are you charging me extra? Let's try to avoid that on the next invoice.

**Me:** I think that's on you, honestly.

_I work for a web design and hosting company for doctors, and through that we manage their emails through the same hosting._

**Client:** I can't sign in to my email, you guys changed my password for no reason.

**Me:** We did not. What is the password you're using for which email?

**Client:** The password is ******* and the email is client@domain.

**Me:** Dot com or dot net?

**Client: **I'm trying to sign in to my email, not go to my website, are you an idiot?

_After twenty minutes of me trying to convince him to add the .com to the end of his email, I finally signed in to it myself to show him it was working, and when he tried it himself he spent a solid three minutes of signing out and signing in again muttering about how that didn't make sense. I left him with an outlook set up guide and a passive aggressively extensive guide on how to type in the correct email and password._

_For the record, [this guy is also a doctor](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/127158127100/i-recently-went-to-a-gi-doc-because-i-was). _

_I was developing a website for a client[ for a flat fee](http://clientsfromhell.net/post/144497102848/when-and-why-you-should-stop-charging-an-hourly). His business was selling machines that I didn't understand at all, so every meeting I'd remind him that he needed to supply me with written content for the site. I finished the site, sent it to the client, and was still waiting for the copy to add to it. _

_Two weeks later he "checked up" on me. _

**Client:** Well let's see your progress!

**Me:** Well - the site is done, but there's no copy in it yet. We're waiting on you for that.

**Client: **What? It's been two weeks! How have you not done anything in that time?

**Me: **The site is done. I'm not a writer, and I don't know anything about what you sell. Once you give me the copy, I'll add it the site and it will be done.

**Client: **(furious) I'm paying you for your services, how can you NOT have made any progress? I need this site done!

**Me: **The site IS done. The writing is not. We agreed on this when we started.

C**lient:** So you haven't done anything at all since we last talked.

**Me: **Once you give me the write-ups, the site will be ready to launch in a day.

**Client:** But you have NO progress to show! I PAID you to show progress.

_Keep in mind, he was supposed to pay me a flat fee - he wasn't paying me for the last two weeks. _

_This song and dance continued for another five minutes before I walked out. He, to this day has not updated his website._
