_Captured: 2017-03-20 at 14:37 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/this-week-in-mobile-17-march?edition=285896&utm_source=Daily%20Digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dd%202017-03-19)_

The big news this week is that [Apple seems to be rejecting apps](https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/07/apple-cracks-down-on-hot-push-code-sdks/) that use Rollout and similar SDKs from the App Store. Basically, Apple doesn't want developers making changes to their apps once the review process is completed. Have you had first-hand experience with this?

## iOS 

If you've been promising to build yourself a game (like I have!) then you should get your head around SpriteKit. Jeremy Jacobson has two great articles on the topic, one on [the basics](https://hackernoon.com/swift-spritekit-basics-94b1798ab639#.vy9l8vwkc), and one on [SpriteKit Physics](https://medium.com/@jjacobson/spritekit-physics-14331398b308#.kw8py8r7d).

I'm using Realm in my latest app, and I've been really happy with the API so far. But how does its performance compare with SQLite on iOS? Find the answer [here](https://tech.iheart.com/performance-comparison-of-realm-and-sqlite-on-ios-6df1d51e6a07?source=---------8----------&gi=227e7b2bf05e).

In [Swift Sequences: The Art of Being Lazy](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/swift-sequences-the-art-of-being-lazy-5b4bd99b159a#.hck3ds2dm), John Sundell explains how you can gain big performance benefits from implementing a lazily evaluated sequence in place of the usual array.

Some projects to check out:

  * [Pageboy](https://github.com/msaps/Pageboy): A simple, highly informative page view controller

  * [SelectableTextView](https://github.com/jhurray/SelectableTextView): A text view that supports selection and expansion.

  * [JSUStockChat](https://github.com/BestSwift/JSUStockChat): JSUStockChat is an easy way to make stock charts with Auto Layouts and storyboards.

## Android 

Joe Birch continues his series on Firebase with [Exploring Firebase on Android: Dynamic Links](https://medium.com/exploring-android/exploring-firebase-on-android-dynamic-links-7364def74808#.1h5qa5x0l). If you've ever wanted to create deep links that can deal with the app not actually being installed and maintain state, this is what you need.

You might have played around with TensorFlow, but have you tried integrating the machine learning library in your Android app? If this is something you'd like to do, check out this [Android TensorFlow Machine Learning Example](https://blog.mindorks.com/android-tensorflow-machine-learning-example-ff0e9b2654cc#.iqcdkghwu).

Handing component dependencies is great in Dagger, but you can run into problems when you rotate your screen and have scoped dependencies. Here's an article on [Retaining Dagger components across configuration changes using Service-Tree](https://medium.com/@Zhuinden/retaining-dagger-components-across-configuration-change-using-service-tree-3709c78bf6d2).

Some projects to check out:

  * [Phonograph](https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph): A material designed music player for Android.

  * [DiscreteScrollView](https://github.com/yarolegovich/DiscreteScrollView): Scrollable list of items, where current item is centered and can be changed using swipes.

## General 

Here's an excellent list of [The Best YouTube Channels for Designers and Developers](https://uxdesign.cc/the-best-youtube-channels-for-designers-and-developers-eda97b38d46a#.ubxhn8n0o). Perfect background viewing when you're working on side projects in the evening.

There's an art to displaying data. With all the charting libraries available, it's easy to tend towards overkill. Here are[ 3 Common Mistakes in Data Visualisation](https://uxdesign.cc/3-common-mistakes-in-data-visualization-6f1c1ca76cb2#.2m5vx43sn) that you should watch out for.
