Everyone used to joke that it seemed like the airlines were "packing us in like sardines" more and more these days.

Now they're really talking about doing it.

Well, sorta.

Airbus, one of the world's two major makers of big commercial jets, [has filed for patent rights on a design to quite literally stack passengers one on top of the other](http://news.sky.com/story/1565901/airbus-plans-stacked-seating-for-passengers) in the prone position, like sardines in a tin.

You can't make this stuff up, people.

It's hard to imagine a more brain-dead, tone-deaf and oblivious idea coming from an industry under extraordinary levels of public criticism for its failure to regard paying customers as human beings deserving of at least a modicum of comfort, dignity and considerate service. But somehow the geniuses at Airbus' design studio in Hamburg, Germany rose - or sank - to the task.

Okay, let's tap the brakes, here. It's just a concept submitted by the Airbus folks to the [U.S. patent office](http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&docid=20150274298&IDKey=04108B8962F7&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D12%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPG01%2526s1%3Dairbus%2526OS%3Dairbus%2526RS%3Dairbus). It's only one of several hundred they submit each year to protect their intellectual rights should they - or somebody else - someday actually decide to market such a product. As a simple matter of statistical probability the chances are pretty slim that this particular seating concept will ever take to the air.

More importantly, it's hard to imagine how any airline executive with still-functioning gray-matter between his/her ears would actually move ahead with such an idea.

Then again, there's a long history of airline managers doing really stupid stuff that everyone - but them - knew from the git-go was a really stupid idea. Let me refresh your memory on that point: MetroJet, MGM Grand Air, Shuttle by United, TED, Continental Light, Delta Express, Song, Braniff II, Braniff III, Trump Shuttle, Independence Air, Legend Airlines, Maxjet, Muse Air, Mountain West Airlines, Pan Am Shuttle, Pan American Airways (1996-1998), Pan American Airways (1998-2004), Pan Am Express, PeoplExpress, People Express and Pride Air. And that's just the short list.

Sometimes these silly ideas get floated as trial balloons that promptly get shot down. Remember a few years ago when controversial, blunt-talking Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryan Air in Ireland, floated the concept of "[standing" seats ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11386342/New-call-for-standing-seats-on-planes.html)in the back of his planes that would be sold at exceptionally low prices? The "seats" looked more like angled posts with bicycle seats mounted on top. Passengers would sorta lean or squat on them and hold on to subway-style hanger straps.

Yeah, that one got shot down almost immediately. The public was outraged that O'Leary, noted for his views on how to give passengers the least amount of service and space possible in order to lower fare prices and turn his airplanes into flying commuter rail cars, would even consider such a plan.

Now the Airbus designers are trying to figure out ways to solve the same problem on which O'Leary - who actually may have not been seriously considering standing seats but rather just pulling our collective leg - was focusing: how to use the maximum amount of space in a plane to generate extra revenue?

Airline managers forever have struggled with the question. They can add more seats to increase the number of paying passengers. But doing so reduces the quality of the travel experience. That, in turn, lowers the price point beyond which travelers won't pay and, simultaneously reduces demand as some percentage of people conclude that the lack of space and comfort renders their contemplated trip not worth it. That's why Airbus, Boeing and other design studios are looking a number of different seating configurations: how can they stuff more people into the same narrow metal tubes without diminishing the flying experience so much that revenues actually decline rather than grow?

Previously I've written in this space about [an insanely dense seating configuration in which every middle seat in a three-seat row would be turned to face rear-ward](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielreed/2015/07/17/rear-facing-airline-seats/). That too was a seating configuration for which a patent was being sought.

In this new case, the Airbus designers appear to be trying to figure out how to use the most significant amount of unused square footage on every passenger jet - the space between passengers' heads and the ceiling. They propose staggering seat rows with the first row mounted on the cabin floor and the second row elevated a couple of feet. The down/up alternating arrangement would be repeated all the way to the back of the cabin. The elevated seats would be reached by steps.

The selling point would be that each seat could be reclined by 130 to 180 degrees. Yippee! I can lay down in flight and sleep!

Sounds good. But, in effect what would result would be the stacking of passengers in prone or mostly-prone positions in little rectangular sleeping boxes not big enough to sit up in, or to roll over in. It would look something like old train sleeper cars, only not nearly as wide, or as comfortable.

And there are other, extremely obvious problems with the idea.

As any six footer who has flown knows, there's not much head room in airliners, not even in the newest models like the Airbus 380 or the Boeing 787. You can only elevate seats a little bit before you'd be pushing the heads of those seated in the high chairs up against the ceiling. Can you imagine the airlines having to create rules limiting the occupants of those seats to being no more than 5'10", or shorter?

Similarly, those seated in the floor seats would have the uncomfortable experience of having a stranger or two look over their shoulders throughout the flight.

And what if the guy on top wants to recline his seat 180 degrees, but the woman on the floor one row behind him wants to sit up and read or tap away on a laptop? I can see the guy who invented "Knee Defenders" that prevent the person in the seat ahead of you from reclining back into your lap already working on a new design for "Head Defenders" to keep the guy up top from reclining down onto your noggin.

It's also almost certain that elevated seating would cause a dramatic reduction over the amount of overhead bag storage space. People today already come close to throwing punches in battles over who gets how much of the limited available space in those bins. Can you imagine how bad it would get when a big reduction in bin space?

And who would want to be on the bottom bunk below a small child who's a bed wetter (or an adult with "control" issues)?

Airline legal departments also will see the red flags flying over the idea of positioning passengers on seats/beds 3 - 5 feet in the air. One little encounter with mid-air turbulence would send any unbuckled passengers crashing down onto the floor - or other passengers - below. It would be a field day for slip-and-fall lawyers.

There also are more serious concerns. Airbus says it foresees the design being used mostly in business class cabins. Count me as skeptical about that, given the reasons above.

More likely, if it ever were to be used, it would be used to pack more folks into coach. But no matter which compartment it's used in, it would increase the number of people onboard each plane. And that opens the door to serious safety and manufacturing problems.

To be certified for passenger service, manufactures must prove their planes can be evacuated within 90 seconds using only half of the plane's exits (this assumes the other half can't be used because of fire or damage). That requirement sets up a mathematical equation that dictates how many doors and emergency exits each plane must have because there is a practical limit to the number of people who can pass through any exit in 90 seconds. Increasing passenger capacity therefore would force manufacturers to redesign their aircraft and manufacturing processes to increase the number of doors and exits.

Then there's the matter of weight. Human flight, as you might have noticed, is unnatural. The laws of physics must be defeated in order for it to happen. We do that by strapping huge engines onto aerodynamic machines and going really, really fast. Hopefully that pushes the aerodynamic machines into the air before they run out of runway pavement. It works nearly every time.

But unbeknownst to the passengers onboard, there's often a very thin margin between the total weight of the people, baggage cargo, fuel, and water onboard - plus the weight of the aircraft itself - and the maximum allowable takeoff weight limit. Go beyond that weight limit and the engines won't be able to generate enough thrust to achieve takeoff before the concrete or asphalt below gives way to prairie grass, dirt or water.

A capacity increase of, say 20% or 30% could easily push many of today's aircraft over their takeoff and landing weight limits. That would require very expensive redesigns of engines and aircraft structures or, more likely, whole new fleets of planes. Designing and certifying new airliners costs billions of dollars per plane. That's why each plane cost $100 million or more, depending on its size.

So don't get all worried about someday having to fly in such a seating configuration. It's very unlikely to happen.

Still, it's fine by me if Airbus - or Boeing - wants to keep paying their designers to come up with these silly, impractical and unworkable new seating designs. It's their money. And it provides good fodder for late night TV comics - and for writers like me.
