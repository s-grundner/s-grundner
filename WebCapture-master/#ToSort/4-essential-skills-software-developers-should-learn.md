Software developers help the world go round. If you want to succeed as a software developer, the realm of your responsibilities will need to extend much further than just the development of software. A lot goes into the job, and going the extra mile can make you an incredible employee. If you want to soar to the top of your field, you need to consider what extra skills that will increase your value as a software developer.

## **1\. A Sole Programming Language **

Most software developers have a tendency to dabble with multiple programming languages. Unfortunately, this won't always turn you into a jack of all trades. Rather than spreading yourself too thin, consider learning a single programming language and mastering it. You'll be able to understand and fix errors within that language with less troubleshooting.

After you become very [comfortable with a sole language](http://lifehacker.com/which-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-1477153665), you may want to consider adding another one. Things like Ruby and Python are invaluable, but only if you truly comprehend them. Don't bite off more than you can chew at once -- it will eat away at your productivity by making it take a lot longer than necessary to successfully complete a project.

## **2\. IT Skills**

Security is a massively important part of your job. You may be working with dedicated cyber security professionals who are tasked with guarding the safety of your data, but they won't be around to watch every move you make. It's worthwhile to [develop IT skills](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff944586.aspx). You'll be able to spot and address security concerns as they arise. If you ever decide to become an independent software developer, you can always take your IT skills with you to your new enterprise.

It's easy enough to learn IT skills. You can even [take IT courses](http://www.careerfaqs.com.au/courses/it/) online if you need flexible scheduling. Anyone who works with computers and the internet will find these skills to be massively valuable.

## **3\. Communication**

As a software developer, you're required to collaborate with large groups of people. Each of those individuals will be responsible for a different aspect of the job, and developing a good rapport with your colleagues is important for productivity, project management and coordination.

You might unknowingly be making things complicated by speaking in too specific of a language. Make sure you're [being an active listener](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-be-a-better-listener/) before you relay information or provide your input. If you don't know, it's better to ask questions than assume you understand what's being said.

## **4\. Teamwork **

You know your part of the job very well. You understand your responsibilities and what part of achieving the vision falls into your lap. As a direct result of that knowledge, you may be too quick to shoot down other ideas. Maybe it isn't your turn to be the innovator; perhaps it's the right time for the experience of one of your colleagues to shine. Don't be so quick to shoot down an idea, and do learn to accept criticism with dignity and grace. Being a software developer can become surprisingly stressful at times, and nothing will turn up the stress level faster than the reluctance to be a team player.
