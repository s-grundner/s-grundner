_Captured: 2018-03-07 at 19:43 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/aye-aye-ai-exploring-nlp?edition=366213&utm_source=Daily%20Digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily%20Digest%202018-03-07)_

Ahoy, AI mateys! Last time, we took off on a journey to [explore the ocean of predictive analytics](https://dzone.com/articles/aye-aye-ai-exploring-predictive-analytics). Today, we're exploring the world of natural language processing (NLP). We'll dive into some of the top NLP articles on DZone, take on unchartered waters to get info from elsewhere, and explore the realm of publications to learn the ins and outs of NLP. It's time to set sail and become the captain of S.S. NLP. Arggg!

## The Keys to NLP

Shiver me timbers! DZone has a lot of articles on natural language processing. Check out some of the best of the best below and enhance your knowledge so you won't get stuck swabbing the poop deck.

  1. [A Guide to Natural Language Processing (Part 1)](https://dzone.com/articles/a-guide-to-natural-language-processing-part-1) by Gabriele Tomassetti. In this extensive and very well-received five-part series, get an introduction to the world of NLP and learn about some basic algorithms for stemming and splitting words automatically.
  2. [Diving Into Natural Language Processing](https://dzone.com/articles/natural-language-processing-adit-deshpande-cs-unde) by Adit Deshpande. From an author who never fails to contribute awesome AI content, learn about applying deep learning to natural language processing.
  3. [Why Natural Language Processing Is the Future of Business Intelligence](https://dzone.com/articles/why-natural-language-processing-is-the-future-of-b) by Gur Tirosh. Until now, we've been interacting with computers in a way that _they_ understand, rather than _us_. We've had to learn _their_ language. Learn about how now, they're learning _ours_ -- thanks to NLP.
  4. [Applying Natural Language Processing to Decode a Movie](https://dzone.com/articles/applying-nlp-to-decode-an-indian-classical-movie-s) by Ritesh Sinha. Learn how to apply natural language processing to understand the relationship between various characters in the classic Indian movie _Sholay_.
  5. [AI-Powered NLP: The Evolution of Machine Intelligence From Machine Learning](https://dzone.com/articles/ai-powered-nlp-the-evolution-of-machine-intelligen) by Tuhin Chattopadhyay. In this article from the [DZone Guide to Artificial Intelligence](https://dzone.com/guides/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-and-predi), learn how to achieve automated real-time question-answering, emotional connotation, and more with NLP.

## NLP From Across the Sea

We're plundering the waters of afar to become the richest of all the natural language processing pirates.

  * [Research at Google: Natural Language Processing](https://research.google.com/pubs/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html). This research -- 383+ publications, to be exact -- focuses on algorithms, traditional NLP tasks, part-of-speech tags, semantics, and more.
  * [Natural Language Processing: Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvTtapxa9c). In this video, learn how computers understand speech and also speak themselves. 

  * [Natural Language Processing on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing). This course is for those who have already taken some courses on ML and DL, but haven't applied those models to texts and want to get a quick start.

## Yo Ho Ho and a Guide and a Refcard!
