# 101 UX Principles: Donâ€™t Join the Dark Side [Excerpt]

[Learn how error monitoring with Sentry](https://dzone.com/go?i=299453&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsentry.io%2F_%2Flp%2Ftelephone-game-ebook%2F%3Futm_source%3Dadvertisement%26utm_medium%3Dtext%26utm_content%3Ddzonewebdevzone%26utm_campaign%3Dsponsorship) closes the gap between the product team and your customers. With Sentry, you can focus on what you do best: building and scaling software that makes your users' lives better.

People check their smartphones _a lot_. One reason for this is that, in some way, it's a gamble. You check your phone and maybe there are no notifications or maybe there's a 'red blob'. Maybe someone's liked your Facebook post or someone's 'faved' your Instagram picture of your brunch or your pet.

Each time you get a notification, you feel happy: your brain releases a little bit of dopamine. So you wait a little while and you check your phone again, hoping for the same result and reinforcing the addictive behavior loop.

This isn't an accident. Many modern products, especially in social media, are _designed_ to be addictive. In _[Hooked: A Guide to Building Habit-Forming Products](https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked)_, psychologist Nir Eyal proposes the Hook model: "The Hook Model -- a four-step process that, when embedded into products, subtly encourages customer behavior. Through consecutive 'hook cycles,' these products bring people back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging."

Next, there are so-called 'dark patterns', which are UI or UX patterns designed to _trick _the user into doing what the corporation or brand wants them to do. These are, in a way, exactly the same as the scams used by old-time fraudsters and rogue traders, now transplanted to the web and updated for the post-internet age. You'll definitely have come across some of these:

  * Shopping carts that add extra 'add-on' items (like insurance, protection policies, etc.) to your cart before you check out, hoping that you won't remove them
  * Search results that begin their list by showing the best item _they'd like to sell you _instead of the best result
  * Ads that don't look like ads, so you accidentally tap them
  * Changing a user's settings: edit your private profile and if you don't explicitly make it private again, the company will switch it back to public
  * Unsubscribe 'confirmation screens', where you have to uncheck a ton of checkboxes _just right_ to actually unsubscribe
  * Software in the engine management computer which checks if the vehicle is being emissions tested and, if so, lowers the performance and emissions

And so on. There are hundreds. Please don't do any of them.

In some fields, medicine for example, professionals have a code of conduct and ethics that forms the core of the work they do. Building software does not have such a code of conduct, but maybe it should do.

All of these dark patterns and addictive products were designed by normal people working in normal software companies -- they had a choice. They chose to fight for the company, not the user. Be a good UX professional and don't join the dark side.
