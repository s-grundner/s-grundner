Enterprises across industries are going mobile. Businesses strive hard to meet the aim of achieving a greater market share. Strategies continue to evolve with the rapid changes in technology. The ubiquitous use of mobile devices has introduced a new method of communication between businesses and customers. This method includes usage of mobile applications. This has given rise to development and testing of mobile apps that help in improving the scope of achieving and maintaining a market share.

## Key Challenges in Mobility Testing

### Mobile Network Operators

There are over 400 mobile network operators in the world. This includes CDMA, GSM, and even less common network standards like FOMA and TD-SCDMA. Each network operator uses a different network infrastructure which can have limits in the flow of information.

### Availability of Devices

The list of devices is ever-growing and spread across different locations. Getting the right set for testing with the required operating system versions can be challenging.

### Selecting the Testing Method

Mobility testing is executed on real devices or emulators. However, both the techniques have their own drawbacks. Certain issues are only caught by testing on real devices which are otherwise missed by emulators. However, there are different types of devices on the market and testing on these real devices can be prohibitively costly and time-consuming.

The best practices in mobility testing services that benefit the business are as follows:

\- Demographics of the customer base and scope of the app: Statistics on targeted customer behavior patterns help in downsizing the elaborate testing efforts. This leads to a renewed focus on the important features that meet customer requirements.

\- Priority device group: Mobile device groups are created with selected mobile devices as per targeted demographic statistics. The devices could vary in the parameters of operating systems, screen resolutions, memory factors, etc. Features of the applications are tested for usability and meeting app feature criteria.

\- Testing with standard test methods: Functional as well as non-functional testing capabilities pertaining to web and desktop applications are also applicable to mobile application testing methods, with some alteration.

\- Testing with data networks: For a mobile app that needs Internet connectivity, application testing with data networks is an important test criterion. The features of the application must be tested for fidelity on data networks like LTE, 3G, or Wi-Fi or even EDGE and GPRS. In such a testing practice, the mobile app is also tested for seamless app performance even in the case of network transition.

\- Mobile application security testing: Mobile applications require access to specific user data. Users certainly are concerned about the security maintained with this data. In order to assure complete privacy of the user data, mobile applications have to be tested for secure payment process (if applicable), certifications required, secure network protocols, and login permissions.

It is the seamless user-friendliness and meeting the requirements of the application that mark its success. A systematic testing strategy ensures a mobile application's quality and performance. Putting together the best and suitable mobile testing practices certainly paves the way for a successful mobile application release.
