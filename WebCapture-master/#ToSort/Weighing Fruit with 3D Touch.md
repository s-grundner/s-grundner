So I took what FlexMonkey created, added an extension to UITouch which provided the weight and percentage of total allowable force, did some normalizing with my kitchen scale, some 8th grade math and Tadaah! We're weighing fruit accurately on an iPhone.

Sadly, I didn't have any plums, so I had to use a tomato. I tried with potatoes too, and it didn't work, so I'd say for right now, the iPhone 6S is only good for weighing soft-skinned fruit and vegetables. That's what $649 buys you these days I guess.

I'd take the accuracy of this with a grain of salt, because I noticed when different tomatoes were placed differently, the weight changed slightly (within 5 grams or so). This is part and parcel of using a smartphone to weigh things.
