Choosing which language to use for an Internet of Things project can be as big a decision as choosing a hardware platform. Here are 11 options to consider for your next coding project. 

![Java
C and C++ were designed from the ground up to allow very direct control of the hardware on which they would run. That's a good factor when you're trying to do very fine-grained monitoring and control of that hardware, and it means that the code written is very specific to the hardware. In programming parlance, the code is not terribly portable.
Java was written to be an object-oriented language that is incredibly portable: There are very, very few hardware dependencies built into the compiler. In order to get the specific, fine control over particular pieces of hardware, Java depends on hardware-support libraries that are called from the generic code.
All of this makes Java great from an economic standpoint: An investment in Java code can be paid back across many different platforms. Java is also taught as one of the primary programming languages in hundreds of computer science and electrical engineering degree programs, so finding someone with Java skills is not terribly difficult. The difficulties come in making sure that your chosen platform supports Java \(less powerful platforms are less likely to have Java support\) and that the hardware support libraries available to you have all the control functions you need.
