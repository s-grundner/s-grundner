# “No Problems is Problem” – Video

_Captured: 2017-01-17 at 11:31 from [www.leanblog.org](http://www.leanblog.org/2010/05/no-problems-is-problem-video/)_

I've heard the famous Toyota "no problems is problem" story (and retold it) many times.

Here is a YouTube video with a version of the story right from a primary source who used to work at Toyota in Canada, Erik Hager.

This story gets right to the core of the difference in traditional management and Lean management. Traditional management sticks its head in the sand and doesn't see problems, or they have too much pride to admit them. Or, they're afraid (often rightfully) of the "help" they might get.

Lean management is all about making problems visible so we can work together and constructively to make improvements without blame.

I know the title of the video says "Lean Sensei" and regular readers know I [don't like the profligate use of that term](http://www.leanblog.org/2010/01/10-lean-things-to-not-say-2010/). I've met Erik and he's the real deal (as [explained in this blog comment](http://www.leanblog.org/2010/01/10-lean-things-to-not-say-2010/#comment-9867)).

Back to the point, what is your organization doing to create an environment where it's OK to have problems as long as you're fixing them?
