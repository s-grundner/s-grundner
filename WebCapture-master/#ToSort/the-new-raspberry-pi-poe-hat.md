# The New Raspberry Pi PoE HAT

Announced alongside [the new Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://blog.hackster.io/meet-the-new-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-2783103a147) this morning was an official [Power over Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet) (PoE) HAT to accompany the board. The HAT is not scheduled to be released until the summer, and beyond the fact it existed, there were few other details availableâ€¦ at least until now.

As Farnell has now published [a product page](http://cpc.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/rpi3-modbp-poe/poe-hat-for-raspberry-pi-3-model/dp/SC14884) for the new PoE HAT.

It is Class 2 device, and Power over Ethernet (PoE) 802.3af compliant, with a fully isolated Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS). Input voltage range can be between 36 and 56V, with an output voltage is 5V at 2.5Amps.

It is "plug-and-play" compatible with the new [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://blog.hackster.io/meet-the-new-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-2783103a147), although obviously not with previous models, and the product page suggests that the onboard fan may be controllable--perhaps over GPIO?

While the addition of PoE to the latest Pi is probably the result of pressure from commercial users--who account for about a third of all sales--the inclusion of the PoE headers on the board itself hasn't been given a universal welcome.

While the physical specification of the PCB mounting holes for the new Model B+ board are in the same place [as the Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/Raspberry-Pi-3B-V1.2-Mechanical.pdf), the Foundation has acknowledged that there may be some problems with third-party cases that clash with the new PoE header block.

> "Cases which make assumptions about the z-height of particular points over the surface of the board may have issues. Examples would be cases which intrude into the space occupied by the new 4-pin PoE header, or which have components designed to thermally couple to the top of the processor package which now has greater z-height." _-- Eben Upton, Founder, Raspberry Pi Foundation_

However it's yet unclear whether the headers will really interfere with existing HATs, as others aren't seeing any problems quite yet.

The new HAT will be priced at Â£17.75 (including VAT), which is just under $25 at current exchange rates, and should be available from summer 2018.
