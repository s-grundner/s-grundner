_Captured: 2016-03-22 at 23:46 from [www-160.aig.com](https://www-160.aig.com/innovativetech?cmpid=BAC-Upfluence-AIG-IoT_InfluencerProgram-ReadWrite)_

Innovative technology, including the Internet of Things (IoT), is changing the world we live in. Realizing its potential starts with understanding the value it can bring.

Here are a few ways how AIG is using innovative technology to better serve customers. Pilots are happening now. Complete the contact form for more information.

While the IoT still holds many unknowns, an AIG survey found that twice as many people were optimistic about it than fearful.

To learn more, AIG partnered with experts to produce a series of reports that explore how new opportunities can alter the landscape of risk across multiple industries.

Today, employers invest in hard-hats on construction sites and ergonomic designs for offices to enhance worker safety, output, and job satisfaction. What more could employers do for their employees with sensored worksites?

AIG believes that technology can help make workers safer. That's why we've invested in a new startup called Human Condition Safety, an early-stage company that couples wearable technology with artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM). Human Condition Safety creates a comprehensive solution to workplace risk, with a platform that enables workers to reduce injuries and employers to improve operational efficiency. For example Human Condition Safety's technology can detect when a worker carries too much weight, makes a "bad bend," or enters an area that puts them at risk for injury because of environmental conditions or getting too close to dangerous equipment.

As Human Condition Safety's exclusive insurance partner, this new approach will help our clients turn data-driven insights into actionable results and create an enhanced safety ecosystem.

A pilot is currently happening at Citi Field in New York, and others are planned for additional locations. Please contact us for more information.

Turning big data into actionable intelligence requires the ability to find information that matters to your business. AIG's Client Centric Analytics does this by using advanced analytics to pinpoint loss drivers, improve safety, and ultimately reduce the total cost of risk. Together with our clients, we help develop customized solutions and safety programs by looking for patterns in their claims data and that of their peers to predict areas of risk.

Already we're producing results for businesses across multiple industries. CCA quantified "frustration" in the claims process which led to the implementation of an advocacy program for a temporary staffing firm, helped a construction company calculate the return on investment for advanced safety gloves after understanding the true cost of hand injuries, and helped a hotel chain identify a leading cause of housekeeping injuries which is now impacting future room designs.

Businesses, cities and people continue to become more vulnerable to cyber threats as our world becomes even more connected. Cyber-attacks can mean more than lost data, identity recovery, and multistate notification. They can mean reputational damage, bodily injury, and property damage as well.

Constantly monitoring the cyber landscape, AIG keeps clients at the forefront of the industry as cyber risk continues to evolve. The preventative tools, technology, and expertise of our expert partners such as K2 Intelligence, Risk Analytics, IBM, and more provide our clients with the knowledge, training, security, and consultative solutions to help them stay ahead of the curve.

** _Virtual Reality_**   
New ways of experiencing risk, including Virtual Reality, will bring exposures to the fore in stunning detail. Clarity brings precision, which could help prevent loss in more effective and strategic ways. AIG partnered with Clemson University, a renowned research and engineering institution, to enhance loss prevention training through the use of Virtual Reality.

As a result of their training at Clemson, AIG's engineers and analysts will be able to use virtual reality to simulate an array of hazardous scenarios - from a manufacturing plant with flammable liquids to the faulty roof of a building - and mitigate real-world exposures from a safe, controlled environment.

** _Unmanned Aircraft_**

Unmanned aircraft, or drones, are changing the way businesses are thinking about their operations and relationships with customers. For example, airlines are using drones to inspect planes, construction companies are using them to measure the progress of building sites, and logistics firms are delivering differently.

AIG is using drones to help manage risks and help assess claims faster, safer and more accurately. In fact, AIG was one of the first insurers approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate drones for risk assessment and management. In response to the growing number of remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous aircraft, AIG was the first insurer to offer unmanned aircraft hull and liability coverages. In fact, AIG won the 2014 innovation award from Business Insurance for designing and offering specifically tailored drone coverage.
