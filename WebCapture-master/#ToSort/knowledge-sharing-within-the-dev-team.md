Software development is not an easy task, even for a Senior Developer. Especially today when the products all include new high-level technologies. And what are you supposed to do when you work with a legacy project with a lot of server configurations only known by one person, and suddenly this person goes on a vacation?

Well, this is a question to solve.

What you can do is call your teammate all the time and ruin his/her trip. But how can we bypass this situation?

As this recently happened with me, I decided to gather general methodologies that will help share knowledge within the team and make it easy to access. As you know the rule - you don't need to know everything, you need to know where to find the information you need.

So here are those tips:

**1\. Start a Wiki page for your project. **The situation that sometimes happens is that every developer in a team works with specific APIs, configurations, or technologies, so it would be great to have everything documented so the other person could easily find it and read it. As we use Jira as a project management tool, I recommend using Confluence to document important things that can block the performance of your team.

**2\. To start Demo meetings within your team or with your client.** When you prepare yourself for a demo, you will need to document the improvements you have implemented. And, as a result, your notes will be shared at the meetings and will be saved for future emergencies.

**3\. Create the culture of code commenting. **Start simply. Comment only on the things you think are the most important. And gradually it will become an everyday habit.

These three tips are not all there is, but they will help you to get started. If you have any ideas how to improve this process please share. I will be happy to hear your comments.
