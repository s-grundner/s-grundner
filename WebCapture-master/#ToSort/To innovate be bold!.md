#### _This is not a guide to incremental thinking._

This article is about learning to innovate. Innovation is not something you do or do not have. It is something that can be learned and can be continuously improved upon. It involves a mindset and a process. Everyone wants to start with that flash that gives you the perfect idea. Sometimes that happens but it is not consistently repeatable, and certainly not which can be scaled up. We need a strategy for innovation to get there reliably and consistently.

### What got you here won't get you there

The magic is all in two little questions which are about what is possible not what is today, **"What might be?" and "How might we?". **To be successful we need to create this mindset, boldness is required! We need to get out of our old frame and into a whole new one.

It goes like this:

  1. **Ask what might be in the future?** This can be 5 years out or whichever timeline is relevant for you. What this does is it gets you out in front, thinking differently. It gives you something to aim for.
  2. **Ask how might we get there?** Now some of this may seem impossible and may in fact not be possible with what you have with you right now. This is where some _magic_ thinking comes in. It is time to shift your frame and move from "can't because" to "can if". **"How might we"** thinking is amazingly powerful. You have to believe it though, this is a frame shift. We create our future.

### Explore first

When starting to look at a problem the single most critical factor is to spend time exploring the problem from different angles. Innovation is not like anything else you execute on. Bring your existing toolkit to the table here and you will arrest innovation before you get started. You have to get broad & wide in generating a diverse portfolio of early ideas! There are usually many ways to tackle something, with varying trade-offs for each. Solutions come later. If you get caught on one idea too early or worry about today's feasibility of something you will limit the ground you cover and quite likely miss out on the most valuable ideas.

> _Remember you are making something new_

It is important to be bold and not hesitate when generating ideas. You will come back to them later once you have a big enough view of all the possibilities. So don't worry if you aren't sure, _get the idea down_. Don't worry if you think the idea isn't as good as one that is already out there, _get the idea down_. The both gets you in the habit and ensures you go broad enough.

### Avoid Groupthink!

Innovation doesn't happen through your usual brainstorming session. Initial idea generation is better when done individually. That can be sitting in the same space but working on your own, however by separating you avoid the amount of upfront contrast you are confronted with and you are less influenced by the direction of the group. This will lead to a much wider and more complete set of ideas. Diverse and well thought through choices in who is in your group is one of the best ways to generate many ideas and ensure different thinking.

Now we need to bring the group back together at some point. Enter [Design Sprints](https://medium.com/redefining-direction/what-is-a-design-sprint-ac27495e932e#.vmfg4rbr2) to solve the issue by providing a framework for executing the best individual brainstorming tasks with the best group aspects in a single process. How this works is you move through various stages (Understand -- Ideate -- Decide -- Prototype -- Validate) where you are flipping between individual and group activities. For example, in the ideate phase you start with individual tasks. In the decide phase the group comes together to work through ideas and compare the various trade-offs. The whole idea here is to create divergent thinking first and give it enough time to pay off.

### Contrast is good

Now that you have gone broad and avoided tunnel vision and group think it is time to take the next step. Here is where we want contrast as we start to go deeper and explore the paths we might take. While comparing ideas and trade-offs you must continually revisit your **"How might we?"** question. Don't let ideas fall off the list based on **"Can we today?"** thinking. This is the largest pitfall of any innovative initiative and any larger innovation effort. If it is feeling painful you are probably on the right track! Design a process to help limit your ties to today's capabilities and constantly discuss and reinforce these principles with the participants. Focusing both on process and discussing with the participants to ensure much more consistent outcomes.

### Think "good" not "right"

We tend to think there is one right answer out there. There isn't. There are always multiple ways to accomplish something and multiple reasons for why you are trying to accomplish that same thing. Big bold ideas developed incrementally allow you to move quickly and pivot just as quickly in practice. The key is to get them started. More Importantly the key is to let them get started. Innovation cannot be told but must be allowed.

Remember innovation is a plan to discover new things that work, not a plan to execute something "innovative". This isn't going to feel like your regular work. Innovation is not like anything else you execute on. Bring your existing toolkit to the table here and you will arrest innovation before you get started.

**To create innovation you must create an environment where you explore first, avoid groupthink, create contrast and think "good" not "right". You must also get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. Getting different results means doing things differently! Innovation cannot be told but must be allowed. Enable boldness and be amazed with the rewards!**
