In the fast-growing world of AI, consumers are getting technological help in all facets of their lives. The internet provides various ways to get information and has radically changed the way we communicate.

Innovation has enhanced our lives with more opportunities, and everything is quite simple for us. Everybody likes to collaborate and expect quick answers without much delay. You can use online networking platforms or websites regularly for various reasons to connect with others.

A chatbot is a program or service that easily connects with you to help solve your queries. The services that a chatbot can deliver are quite diverse, from providing important life-saving health messages to checking the weather forecast to purchasing a new pair of shoes. While interacting with a chatbot, you should feel as if you are talking with a real person.

## **What Is a Chatbot?**

A chatbot is a service, an intuitive operator, and a conversational space rooted in AI. It chats with clients/customers through sound or content, especially over the Internet.

Chatbots are outlined with a predesigned dialog box based on a natural language processing system. When a customer asks a question, the bot reacts quickly. The customer feels as if they are speaking with a human.

The bot chat logs page enables you to include new answers, greetings, phrases, and predefined reactions. You can see the discussions you've had with the bot and accordingly correct its responses to make business strategy by analyzing the chat logs.

The live chat facility implies that you're speaking with a human, though bots are completely robotized.

## **Chatbot Architecture**

Programming languages can be used to build a web API. The back-end gets messages, thinks about a reply, and returns it back to the client. The front-end may be one of the messenger apps or a chat interface and your web server will connect the back-end and front-end.

There are two types of chatbots: bots for amusement and bots for business. Discussion frameworks can generally be separated into two classifications: retrieval-based models and generative-based models.

## **How to Create a Chatbot**

There is a wide range of chatbots of different complexities. There are free and paid services that let you build a chatbot. You can make your own bot and embed it on your website or mobile app, and this requires no programming knowledge.

In order to make a smart chatbot, you need to utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, and language handling.

A bot can be prepared with a few strategies, contents, chat logs, evaluations, and altering reactions in our talk logs. Chatbots are not intelligent by default -- they are prepared for demonstrating extreme levels of intelligence by using technologies such as machine learning, big data, natural language processing, and so on.

There are some pros and cons of chatbots, which are as follows:

  * A chatbot provides a speedy and quick response and available around the clock.
  * The customer care department has constraints on the number of customers they can deal with immediately. But with chatbots, there is no such limitation and they can resolve many queries at the same time.
  * Chatbots are the new revolution, especially for customer service, reducing the impact on humans, helping businesses, and saving a significant amount of time as well as money.
  * There are security vulnerabilities in chatbot that can allow hackers to assault websites and hack content such as email addresses, content, and so on.
  * Strong network security is important for any kind of chatbot.

## **Conclusion**

From my perspective, chatbots or smart assistants with artificial intelligence are dramatically changing businesses. There is a wide range of chatbot building platforms that are available for various enterprises, such as e-commerce, retail, banking, leisure, travel, healthcare, and so on.

Chatbots can reach out to a large audience on messaging apps and be more effective than humans. They may develop into a capable information-gathering tool in the near future.
