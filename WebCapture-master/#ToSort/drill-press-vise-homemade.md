Tired of damaging the wood with metal drill press vices, I decided to make one myself to use only with wood. It is an easy and very useful construction to hold wood pieces and rods.

Almost all the materials are remains of old projects.

In this video I show you the step by step.

I would also apologize for my English as a non-native English speaker some terms are very difficult for me. Forward, Intractable!!

I will be happy to answer any questions.

For this project I set myself to use mostly recycled materials and I think I got it at 90%!!

The first thing I did was looking for a solid piece of wood and I found an old block of pine wood (150mm x 70mm x 90mm) that I had to plane and square until I got totally flat surfaces.

Later, I marked the pieces as shown in the photographs.

## Step 3: Cutting the Main Piece

Once all the pieces marked, I cut them with the help of my beloved [japanese saw](http://amzn.to/2xqcpFj), turning out 3 perfectly squared pieces.

## Step 4: Joining the 3 Pieces

![](https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/S3RV/JAWTYNYR/FMRS3RVJAWTYNYR.SMALL.jpg)

I used 2 rods of beech wood (230mm x 18mm) to join the 3 pieces created. Firstly, I drilled the central piece with a forstner bit of 18mm and once that piece is perforated, I used it as a template to match the holes exactly with the other 2 pieces.

## Step 5: Inserting the Nuts in the Wood

As you can see in the photographs, I marked the center of the piece and then drilled it with a bit of 10mm (Thickness of the metal threaded rod). As previously, I used the hole of this piece to mark the one of the next piece.

Then, I marked its contour with 2 nuts on both sides and with the help of a chisel I removed the wood necessary to insert the nuts which I glued with epoxy.

* Note: I used two nuts but with only one would be enough.

## Step 9: Handle of the Vise

![](https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/05CK/JAWTYPF8/FRV05CKJAWTYPF8.SMALL.jpg)

I used beech wood (a piece of 80mm x 30mm x 30mm) for the handle of the vise which I drilled it with a bit of 10mm giving it an octagon shape with the help of a block plane. I glued it with epoxy glue.

## Step 10: Last Conclusions

I am very happy with the final result, both esthetic and functional, but there are two things that if I were to rebuild it I would improve:

\- I would use a larger diameter threaded rod to make it faster to tighten or loosen.

\- I would not put 2 nuts as a guide for the threaded rod, I only put one inside because it is enough and, furthermore, the movement of the rod is easier with a single nut.

Apart from this, I'm very happy with it and it meets my expectations of what I was looking for: a strong vise that doesn't damage the wood when tighten it.
