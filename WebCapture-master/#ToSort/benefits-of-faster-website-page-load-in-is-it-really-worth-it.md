## It helps in SEO

If you don't care about SEO and organic traffic you can always choose to skip it, but if you really want your website to rank high, increasing your website speed should be your next goal. Google has came a long way since it was launched and now considers hundreds of factors for ranking a website.

In 2010 google announced that website speed will be taken into consideration for ranking websites. Here is what Matt Cuts ( Google webmaster official ) say about website speed and ranking.

Further when he was asked what would be his main SEO strategies if he is hired by a company for SEO. He opted for increasing website speed as one of his main goals.

Not only does it contribute directly to your website ranking as a factor but it has strong influence on a couple of other ranking factors. Google recently incorporated "Bounce Rate" , "Avg Time on Site" and "CTR" into their ranking factors.

[Bounce rate](https://blog.crazyegg.com/glossary/bounce-rate/) the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.

[CTR](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-ctr-defining-click-through-rate-for-online-businesses/) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.

Avg time on site as it appears from it's name is simply the time in seconds a visitor stays on your site before deciding to leave.

So how are these factors impacted by page speed? Let's demonstrate it.

A person comes to your website and found it takes around 8 seconds to load. Most probably he will leave your site right away without even looking into content of current page, forget about navigating another page on your website. It will impact two of google important factors 1. Bounce Rate 2. Avg Time on site. There is quite a chance that he will memorize your website name and will avoid clicking on your website link in future resulting in decrease in CTR.
