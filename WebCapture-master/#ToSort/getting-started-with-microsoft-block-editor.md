> _Getting Started with Microsoft Block Editor for the BBC micro:bit:_

The Microsoft Block Editor is a drag and drop editor for the [BBC microbit](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/microbit.html) that provides a simple introduction to programming. Blocks snap together to build programs and are grouped by the type of function they do. When a group is selected, the commands in the whole group are highlighted and can be selected. It's a great introduction to programming for those with little or no experience.

## Course contents

## Selecting blocks

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _microbit_using_microsoft_block_editor_870](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bbc_microbit_using_microsoft_block_editor_870.jpg)

> _1. Select a block category from the list on the left hand side of the page._

**2.** Select a block from the selected category and drag it to the workspace area on the right.

**3.** Snap new blocks onto existing blocks in the workspace area. As the new blocks are dragged into the workspace, the editor highlights the connecting parts of each block when they are in a valid position to snap to existing blocks.

## Saving scripts

Scripts are automatically saved on your computer's hard drive when you are not logged in. You can access older scripts when you press the 'My Scripts' button in the top left corner of the editor.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _microbit_saving_script_870](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bbc_microbit_saving_script_870.jpg)

> _If you want to switch computers or save the progress of a current script; click on the 'my scripts' button in the top left corner of the editor:_

Once you have clicked on the 'my scripts' button, it will take you to a dashboard with options on what to do with the selected script. Options include saving your script for editing later, exporting the script to another computer (as a .jsz file), cloning the script (for someone else to edit), deleting your script and publishing the script to the BBC micro:bit website.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _microbit_exporting_script_870](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bbc_microbit_exporting_script_870.jpg)

> _How to Delete Blocks using Microsoft Block Editor_

You can delete blocks in three ways. You have to select and highlight the blocks you want to delete (the edges change colour to yellow when the blocks are selected):

**1.** Press the DELETE button on your computer.

**2.** Select and drag the selected blocks into the 'bin' shaped icon in the bottom right hand corner of the editor.

**3.** Select the block and right-click on the selected blocks. A drop-down list will appear and select the 'Delete Block' option.

## Changing a Program Name

A program name will be randomly assigned when the editor is first loaded. To change this; simply click or touch the current name of the program at the top of the editor. You should get a cursor with a light blue surround text box. You can now type in the new name for your program. The editor should automatically save your changes when you are online. If you don't have an internet connection, press the save icon to save your changes.

### LOOPS BLOCKS

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_forever](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_forever.jpg)

**FOREVER Block**

The **FOREVER Block** is one of the most commonly used Block commands. All of the commands that are placed in a forever loop are run in order and then over and over forever!

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_loops_while_do](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_loops_while_do1.jpg)

**WHILE DO Block**

The **WHILE DO Block** will repeatedly run the commands contained within it while the test condition is true, The test condition block snaps to the right of the 'while' text. Once this condition is no longer met, the program will continue on to the commands below this block.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_loops_while_do](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_loops_from_0_do.jpg)

**FOR (I) DO Block**

The **FOR (I) DO Block** repeats a code a fixed number of times. You can specify which code is repeated using the drop-down menu and add a number specifying how many times you want it to be repeated.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_loops_repeat](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_loops_repeat.jpg)

### LOGIC BLOCKS

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_logic_if_do](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_logic_if_do.jpg)

**IF DO ELSE Block**

The **IF DO ELSE Block** tests the condition snapped to the right of the 'if'text. If the condition is 'true' it will execute once the blocks snapped to the right of the 'do' text. If 'false' it will execute once the blocks snapped to the right of the 'else' text. The 'cog' wheel (when clicked on) lets extra 'else if' and 'else' elements to be added to this command. This allows for different commands to be run if different test conditions are met.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_logic_true_false](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_logic_boolean_comparison.jpg)

**BOOLEAN VALUE TRUE/FALSE BlockS**

The** BOOLEAN VALUES TRUE/FALSE Blocks** are used when there are only two opposite answers to the command. Boolean is a logic where the answer can be either yes or no or anything you specify to be the opposite of one another.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_logic_and_or](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_logic_and_or.jpg)

**BOOLEAN BINARY OPERATORS: AND (conjunction); OR (disjunction) BlockS**

The** BOOLEAN VALUES AND (conjunction)/OR (disjunction) Blocks** are used when two blocks need to be compared. The AND block evaluates to true only if both A and B are true, the OR block evaluates to true when either A or B are true.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  microbit_logic_not](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_logic_not.jpg)

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _logic_more_than](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_logic_more_than.jpg)

![microbit_logic_less_than](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_logic_less_than.jpg)

**BOOLEAN COMPARISON OPERATOR BlockS**

The **BOOLEAN COMPARISON OPERATOR Blocks** are operator blocks within Boolean logic. These include =, !=, <, >, <= and >=. A numerical value can be inserted into both sides of these blocks in order to make the function work.

### **MATHS BLOCKS**

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _maths_number](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_maths_number.jpg)

**NUMERIC VALUE Block**

The **NUMERIC VALUE Block** is used to enter numeric values. These are Integers (whole numbers). The value defaults to '0' but can be changed. This Block is often used in Blocks such as the Comparison Operators Block described above.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _maths_times](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_maths_times.jpg)

**ARITHMETIC BINARY OPERATION Blocks**

The **ARITHMETIC OPERATION Blocks** are used to perform an arithmetic (maths) operations on two items. For example by adding them together. It returns the result of this operation. This Block has spaces to place the variable or values to perform the operation on. The drop down box in the centre allows the selection of the operator type (there are five you can select).

**ABSOLUTE VALUE Block**

The **ABSOLUTE VALUE Block** is a block where an absolute value of a function is needed. An absolute value is the distance away from 0 (in either direction) that number is. For example 3 and -3 both have an absolute value of 3.

### VARIABLES BLOCKS

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _variables_item](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_variables_item.jpg)

### **GAME BLOCKS**

## **BBC micro:bit BLOCKS**

### **BASIC BLOCKS**

![BBC micro:bit microbit  _show_leds](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_show_leds.jpg)

**SHOW LEDs Block**

The **SHOW LEDs Block** is used to display an image on the display. If a box is tocked then the corresponding LED will be lit up.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  show_leds](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_clear_screen.jpg)

### LED BLOCKS

![BBC micro:bit microbit  led_brightness](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_led_brightness.jpg)

The **SET BRIGHTNESS TO Block** sets the brightness of the LED screen. Full brightness has a value of 255, so 127 is around 50% brightness. If the brightness is more than 100%, the code automatically sets the brightness to 100%.

![BBC micro:bit microbit  led_plot_bargraph](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_led_plot_bargraph.jpg)

### IMAGES BLOCKS

The **SCROLL IMAGE Block** scrolls the frames within an image on the LED display. To jump from one image to another, use the offset values of '5' to jump to the right and '-5' to jump to the left. The interval time (in ms) controls the speed of the scrolling. The larger the number, the slower the scroll.

![microbit_images_create_image](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_images_create_image.jpg)

**CREATE IMAGE Block**

The **CREATE IMAGE Block** creates an image on the LED display when the image boxes are checked.

![microbit_images_create_big_image](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_images_create_big_image.jpg)

### **BBC micro:bit INPUT BLOCKS**

![microbit_inputs_on_pin_p0_do](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_inputs_on_pin_p0_do.jpg)

The **TEMPERATURE Block** records the ambient temperature of the surface of the BBC micro:bit using the temperature sensor inside the CPU of the BBC micro:bit. This figure won't be as accurate if the BBC micro:bit has been running a number of calculations after a long period of time. The temperature sensor is precise but not accurate as it might return a base line temperature offset (e.g. it will return 20 degrees when the ambient temperature is actually 17 degrees.

![microbit_input_light_level](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_input_light_level.jpg)

![microbit_show_leds](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_inputs_on_shake_do.jpg)

![microbit_input_on_shake_drop_down](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_input_on_shake_drop_down.jpg)

**ON (COMMAND) DO Block**

The **ON (Command) DO Block** has a drop down list of commands.

**ON SHAKE** uses the built-in accelerometer to detect when the BBC micro:bit is shaken, if the BBC logo on the BBC micro:bit is facing up or down.

**ON LOGO UP** registers an event handler that will execute whenever the LED screen is perpendicular to the ground and the BBC micro:bit logo is above the LED screen.

**ON LOG DOWN** registers an event handler that will execute whenever the LED screen is perpendicular to the ground and the BBC micro:bit logo is below the LED screen.

**ON SCREEN UP** registers an event handler that will execute whenever the LED screen is facing the ceiling/sky.

**ON SCREEN DOWN** registers an event handler that will execute whenever the LED screen is facing the floor.

### **PINS BLOCKS**

The **DIGITAL READ PIN (0,1) (P0*) Block** reads the digital voltage on the selected pin and returns a '0' if there is as 'low' voltage or a '1' if it is a 'high' voltage. (A 'low' voltage is anything below 0.8 Volts. A 'high' voltage is anything above 1.6 Volts).

**DIGITAL WRITE (0,1) TO PIN (P0*) Block**

The **DIGITAL WRITE (0, 1) TO PIN (P0*) Block** writes either a '0' (a low voltage) or a '1' (a high voltage) to the specified pin. To change the value that is written to the pin, select the box that has a '1' in it and edit to a '1' or '0' as required.

The **ANALOG WRITE (1024) TO PIN (P0*) Block** writes an analog value (variable voltage) to in P0, P1 or P2 (depending on which is selected). The voltage on that pin will be set to a level defined by the size of the number written where 0 = 0V and 1024 = 3.3V.***SELECTING THE PIN/BUTTON** The 'drop down' arrow next to the default pin 'P0' or button 'A' allows the pin/button which the command write/reads to be changed.

**SERVO WRITE PIN Block**

The **SERVO WRITE PIN Block** writes a value to the servo on to the specified pin (P0, P1, P2), controlling the shaft accordingly:

  * On a standard servo, this will set the angle of the shaft (in degrees), moving the shaft to that orientation.
  * On a continuous rotation servo, this will set the speed of the servo (with 0 being full-speed in one direction, 180 being full speed in the other, and a value near 90 being no movement).
![microbit_pins_map](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/microbit_pins_map.jpg)

**MAP Block**

The **MAP Block (PINS)** re-maps a number from one range to another. That is, a value of from low would get mapped to to low, a value of from high to to high, values in-between to values in-between, etc.

Does not constrain values to within the range, because out-of-range values are sometimes intended and useful. The math-clamp function can be used either before or after this function, if limits to the ranges are desired.

### **DEVICES Blocks**

The **TELL CAMERA TO Block** adds an external camera capability when an external camera is attached to the BBC micro:bit. This command can be to either a smartphone's camera or an externally connected camera. The camera commands include taking a photo, start/stop video capture, toggling front/rear, launch photo/video mode and stop/video/photo mode.

The **RAISE ALERT TO Block** raises an alert in the BBC micro:bit and orders the BBC micro:bit to do an external action. The options in the alert include telling the BBC micro:bit to 'display toast', vibrate, play a sound or ringtone, find my phone and ring an alarm.

![microbit_device_tell_remote_control_drop_down](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/microbit_device_tell_remote_control_drop_down.jpg)

**TELL REMOTE CONTROL TO Block**

The **TELL REMOTE CONTROL TO Block** adds a command to an external supported remote control so you can control and tell the remote control what to do when this command is triggered. The options include telling the remote control to 'play', 'pause', 'stop', 'next/previous track', forward, rewind, volume up and volume down.

**ON NOTIFIED Block**

The **ON NOTIFIED Block** runs a command when BBC micro:bit receives the selected event from a connected device. The available commands are 'incoming call', 'incoming message', 'orientation landscape', 'orientation portrait', 'shaken', 'display off' and 'display on'.
