I frequently need to create [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) from my mobile device. With [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#AboutPlace:about) and a bit of coding ... I was able to develop a publishing workflow to create **_Impressive Google Docs_** from my iOS device while I'm on the go.

Want to try this workflow for yourself? Check out my tutorial **_[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xCy-MjiIBzyhzt2iGjuGG4N3DBWau_kgmZiSQapUOOE/edit?usp=sharing)_**.
