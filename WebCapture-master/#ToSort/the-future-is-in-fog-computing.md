The rise and proliferation of Smart Things gave rise to a massive increase in the volume of digitally generated data. The limitations of current cloud computing have recently become a subject of widespread discussion, and new computing technologies have already arrived as the answer to these emerging challenges. So, we have fog computing.

## **What Is Fog Computing?**

Fog computing terminology refers to a decentralized architecture and serves as an extension to cloud computing by collaborating with one or more edge node devices, providing the subsequent amount of localized control, configuration and management, and much more for end devices, unlike cloud computing where data needs to access the central mainframe. Fog computing allows the cloud-based services expand their reach to the edge of a network of devices to offer local and quicker accessibility to edge devices.

A fog computing network has two planes, the data plane, sometimes referred to as forwarding plane, and the control plane. The data plane determines what happens to the data packets. It allows computing resources to be placed anywhere in the network, as they don't have to be centered on a server as they can be distributed on the edge of the network. The control plane provides an overview of the network, and it functions with the routing protocols that run in the architectural control element. Fog computing allows IoT data to be processed in a data hub or smart device closer to the sensor that's generating it.

With cloud computing, you always had to depend on the cloud repository and accessing data required bandwidth allocation and connectivity. Thanks to fog computing, the data can be accessed in between devices locally without complete dependence on the cloud repository. This will help to boost accessibility, ease of use and contextual usability of device data. The emergence of fog computing will boost collaboration among devices and data centers.

## **How Does Fog Computing Stand Out?**

The world is witnessing a massive surge in terms of digitally generated data from Smart Things and connected devices. On the other hand, with the rise of smartphones and applications enabling more and more users to access data and computation power as well as control and manage their end devices in real-time. Conventional cloud architectures require the smallest data to be sent to the central cloud through edge node devices for computation and analysis, which eventually adds latency. Fog computing, on the other hand, empowers the edge node devices to carry out some **local data processing, cache data management, dense geographical distribution, local resource pooling, load balancing, local device management, latency reduction for better QoS (Quality of Service), and edge node analytics, **resulting in enhanced overall user experiences**.**

## **Working of Fog Computing**

Fog computing implementation bifurcates the data obtained from the closest IoT devices on the most critical aspect - **TIME** as follows:

  * The most time-critical data are locally analyzed by the fog-empowered edge node devices, resulting in the lowest latency and prevention of major damage before it may even occur. Time-critical data can consist of alarm status, fault warnings, device status, and much more
  * Less time-critical data is sent to the central mainframe for a persistent or periodically storage and can be retrieved as and when required. Less time-critical data includes files, reports for historical analysis, device logs, and much more

## **The Key Advantages of Fog Computing**

Fog computing offers several standout advantages over its predecessor, cloud computing. While it utilizes basic cloud computing technology at its core, it addresses several limitations of the cloud computing and helps to boost usability and accessibility in different computing environments. Following are the key advantages that fog computing offers

  * Globally distributed network helps minimal downtime
  * Load balancing
  * Maximize network bandwidth utilization
  * Optimal operational expense
  * Business Agility
  * Better Interconnectivity
  * Enhanced QoS
  * Latency Reduction
