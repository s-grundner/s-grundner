**Brainstorming** is a simple 5 steps collaborative workshop that enables participants to generate, select and enrich ideas that can solve their business problem or challenge.

# 1\. Generate ideas

**Write down all your ideas!**

In this step, try to imagine all the ideas that we could implement to take on the challenge.

Don't forget to follow these rules:

  * _Go for quantity_: write down as many ideas as possible (one card per idea)
  * _Differ judgement_: don't judge the relevance of your own ideas at this step
  * _Encourage wild ideas_: do not stick to top of the head ideas

Note that in this step you cannot see other's ideas.

**Let's discover other's ideas.**

Read all ideas, discuss and if necessary clarify their meaning by discussing.

Notes:

  * You can edit any card to reformulate the idea with better words.
  * You can also merge ideas that are very similar
  * Do not criticize ideas at this step, instead, try to focus on understanding the real meaning behind each idea.

# 3\. Improve other's ideas

**Polish our rough ideas into a diamond!**

Look at the ideas that are the most appealing to you:

  * **Good?** What is good about this idea? What makes it stand out?
  * **Problems?** What concerns do you have about the idea? What problems does it raise? List the shortcomings, gaps, limitations, and weaknesses you can think of.

After listing as many things under **good** and **problems** as you can come up with, it's time to step up your idea with new thinking.

  * **Step it up!** is where you come up with new thinking to make things stronger, building on the key elements from Good and Problems. 

**Which ideas have the most potential?**

You can either give:

  * From 1 to 3 **positive** points to ideas with the most potential
  * From 1 to 3 **negative** points to ideas with the least potential

Notes:

Do not throw away wild and crazy ideas! You must select ideas based on their full potential, not only based on what is already articulated on the card.

# 5\. Discover the top ideas

Look at the bar chart and analyze the results:

  * Which ideas are we going to select for the next step (refinement)?
  * Does the final ranking make sense?
  * Is there any idea with few points that you would like to save?
  * Do we still have some wild ideas in our selection (good) or only safe ideas (bad)?

Once done, put all the non selected ideas aside and decide on what to do next.
