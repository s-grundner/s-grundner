# Learn CSS Grid

_Captured: 2017-03-02 at 01:19 from [jensimmons.com](http://jensimmons.com/post/feb-27-2017/learn-css-grid)_

People are starting to ask: where can I learn about CSS Grid?

There are a lot of fantastic resources out there. When it comes to the technical how-to, most of what's out there was written by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk). If you don't know her work, take some time to get to know her and [follow her](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew).

So here are the links to resources I recommend. I will keep updating this list:

  * Rachel built a website full of examples, that walk you through what Grid can do: [ gridbyexample.com/examples](http://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
  * She also created a series of free screencast tutorials that show off Grid: [gridbyexample.com/video](http://gridbyexample.com/video/)
  * She has started a gallery of common layouts you might want to use: [gridbyexample.com/patterns](http://gridbyexample.com/patterns/)
  * Rachel also put together a polished course on all the CSS you need to know to hand-code layout: <https://thecssworkshop.com> It comes in two parts. You can buy access to Part 1, Part 2 (which includes Grid), or both. (If you are able, paying to access these videos is a great way to support all this work Rachel is doing for free. Also, you'll fill in any gaps in your overall knowledge of layout. I certainly did. There was a bunch of stuff I didn't know, and I didn't know I didn't know it.)
  * Or learn from watching a full-length conference talk (or eight) of her's: [find the most recent](https://www.google.com/#q=rachel+andrew&tbm=vid&*).
  * And as always, MDN has a detailed technical documentation on everything you want to know [about CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) including a well-written [guide to the basic concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout). How'd we put together such a comprehensive expert set of documents? We hired Rachel to write them.
  * Be sure to try out [the Grid Inspector Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts) that is baked into Firefox. It's very hard to code a Grid layout without being able to see your lines. My colleagues at Mozilla and I are aiming to give you a tool that makes it easy to develop and design Grid Layouts in the browser. Many more features have been planned, and will appear over next the year. [Contact me](http://jensimmons.com/contact) with any ideas, requests, comments on how the tool is working out for you. Such feedback -- praise and critique -- helps tremendously in wrangling resources to take things to the next level.
  * And then there's the three years of work I've made, starting with my 2015 talk on layout design: [ Modern Layouts: Getting Out Of Our Ruts  
](http://jensimmons.com/presentation/modern-layouts-getting-out-our-ruts)
  * My 2016 talk on layout design[ Revolutionize Your Page: Real Art Direction on the Web  
](http://jensimmons.com/presentation/revolutionize-your-page-real-art-direction-web)
  * My talk on using new CSS today, even when all the browsers don't support it: [Progressing Our Layouts](http://jensimmons.com/presentation/progressing-our-layouts)
  * And my demos at: [labs.jensimmons.com](http://labs.jensimmons.com)
  * How will we use CSS Grid, even when it's not supported by 100% of browsers? By [Using Feature Queries in CSS](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/).
  * To really understand layout CSS, you should also learn about [CSS Writing Modes](https://24ways.org/2016/css-writing-modes/)
  * Chen Hui Jing wrote a fantastic article, on writing modes: with a [amazing demo](https://www.chenhuijing.com/zh-type/), and [a talk](https://youtu.be/tTV60oAk6Cs?t=1m52s).
  * Jing made a second amazing [Writing Mode demo](http://penang-hokkien.gitlab.io) and wrote a great [article about it.](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/the-one-about-home/#=_) I don't think it uses CSS Grid, but it shows the kind of thinking we'll be using in the future.
  * While you are at it, follow Jing on Twitter, too: [@hj_chen](https://twitter.com/hj_chen)
  * Rachel also made a cheatsheet for the stuff you'll need to look up the most: [Box Alignment Cheatsheet](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/css/cheatsheets/box-alignment)
  * For many people, their first question about Grid is: why should I use this instead of Flexbox? Rachel answers that here: [Should I use Grid or Flexbox?](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/03/30/should-i-use-grid-or-flexbox/)
  * She also answered the all important IE question -- in this case: [Should we try to use the old IE 10 & 11 implementation of Grid?](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/11/26/should-i-try-to-use-the-ie-implementation-of-css-grid-layout/)
  * In fact, so many people are asking Rachel questions, she setup a GitHub repo as an AMA. So just go there and ask her more stuff / find more answers: [CSS Grid Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/rachelandrew/cssgrid-ama)

There will be much more coming from Rachel, Jing and I this year.

I am starting to see a bunch of simple introductions, link-baity false-narratives, and weirdly-wrong ideas to creep into the conversation about CSS Grid. They are not as helpful. Frequently they are actually wrong. Let's please share the best work with each other -- not exclusively work done by men because it seems more respectable / more authoritative / more bro-awesome! And especially, let's not pass around the work published by people who simply copied Rachel's work, badly, with mistakes. In 2017, I have no more patience for these shenanigans. So far, most of the people I've seen learning, teaching and evangelizing CSS Grid are women. If suddenly we all "disappear", and a bunch of men get all the attention, my head might explode.

If you see any new resources that are _good_, do let me know! I want to feature the most helpful work out there. Once you start learning CSS Grid, share what you've discovered. Explain things in a new way that feels helpful. Make demos unlike anything we've seen before. Credit the sources that taught and inspired you. Reference the larger conversation. There is a lot to learn. A lot for us to discover. A lot to invent. This truly is a revolution in graphic design on the web. There's no time, and no reason to be all jockeying for the same worn-out boring territory, trying to make the people -- the women -- who got there first invisible.
