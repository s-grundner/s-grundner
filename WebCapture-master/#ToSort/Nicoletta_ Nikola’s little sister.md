Last night I saw [this post by James Harding](http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/) explaining how to make a simple static blog using Flask.

It got me thinking… how hard would it be, and how much code would it take, to write the same functionality with as few dependencies as possible?

So, instead of breakfast and lunch I got a coffee and a sandwich, and you guys get [Nicoletta](http://github.com/ralsina/nicoletta) a minimalistic static blog generator.

The dependencies are:

And how much code was it? I had guessed 25 lines, and was off by a lot, it's 40. I **could** cheat a little and bring it down to 25, but hey, what's the point?

The code is [up at github](http://github.com/ralsina/nicoletta) and should be self explanatory. If it's not, just ask here in the comments.
