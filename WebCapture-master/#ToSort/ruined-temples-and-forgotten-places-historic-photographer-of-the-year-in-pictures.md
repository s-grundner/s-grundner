The first historic photographer of the year awards showcase the world's very best historic places and cultural sites from across the globe, capturing everything from the most famous national treasures to obscure and forgotten hidden gems. Here, the photographers tell the stories behind their pictures

  *   
This 400-metre-long corridor forms part of an old hospital last used by US military stationed in the UK during the first Gulf war. The site was loaned to American forces in 1984 as a site to treat injured soldiers flown back from Iraq, but only 35 patients were treated there. The site was handed back to the UK in 1995 and remains derelict 

  *   
For hundreds of years, these iconic buildings have survived the Cornish elements, a testament to their ingenious and robust construction. At high tide, the Atlantic waves swirl in all directions, putting on a dramatic show of power and ferocity. Just imagine how these brave tin miners must have felt as they descended into the shaft, which extends half a mile from the coast below the sea bed! 

  *   
Emerson high school in Gary, Indiana, was the first 'work-study-play' school founded in 1908 by William A Wirt. In 1981 Emerson high closed due to a dwindling population, but it reopened in the mid-80s and transformed into a visual and performing arts school. The school was finally closed for good in 2008. This seems to be the office of the band teacher, Mr Daniel Lemmon. On the wall you can kinda see the decaying group photos of band classes headlined by a talent search banner asking students to 'Live the dream'

  *   
Wat Mahathat is a 14th-century temple reduced to ruins in 1767 when the Burmese army invaded Ayutthaya. Over time, a tree has grown around one of the remaining stone Buddha heads, such that it is now completely enclosed by its roots with only the face peeking out 

  *   
Mornings on the river Ganges are often covered with a haze that melts with pollution. The chaos of the landscape inspires the most varied photographs. Varanasi is a world of history, where the sacred is always in evidence. The photo features a daily scene in India's holiest site 

  *   
A quiet winter morning after Chinese new year. I was strolling on the ruins of the Great Wall, built in 1680. I seemed to hear crossing swords and horses neighing 

  *   
This is the monument to Ralph of Shrewsbury, bishop of Bath and Wells (died 1363). It is a very finely carved alabaster monument that has had much graffiti carved into it over the years. Perhaps this shows how history changes our views on individuals. Ralph of Shrewsbury was clearly very highly regarded. How have the mighty fallen! 

  *   
This photo of the 12th-century Augustinian abbey Jedburgh was taken on a class trip in 2011. That class, and that trip, sparked my enduring love for medieval architecture 

  *   
The morning sunlight shines through the abbey's high windows and casts rays of light into the space. I like this view because it hasn't changed much in hundreds of years 

  *   
Built in 1897 to celebrate the golden jubilee of Emperor Franz Josef I, this giant historical attraction is one of the oldest operating ferris wheels in the world. In 1916 a demolition order was issued for the destruction of the Riesenrad, but thankfully the team ran out of money and could not complete the task 

  *   
Opportunities to visit such nuclear bunkers are rare, but the community group Forgotten Front Line and the Woodland Trust recently arranged a day for public access. Although the structure itself, built in 1966, is not particularly remarkable, the experience of visiting it provides a glimpse back to the dark days of the cold war and what might have been. This is the welcome view as you climb up the ladder to the hatch 

  *   
A colour infrared image of this battle site, whose name means 'the wading-place of the river Went'. It was taken in the 70s, but it is only with the advent of modern software that the full beauty of the picture, and the data it holds, can become apparent. The crop mark near the bottom looks very like a Roman mansion, or posting station, alongside road M28b 

  *   
Just outside Uyuni, Bolivia, trains were abandoned decades ago and left to rot at 3,656 metres (11,995ft). Built by the British, the railway transported minerals to the Pacific coast until the mining industry collapsed in the 1940s 

  *   
I was given access to a secret restored second world war bunker. With the help of a local electrical fitter we installed lighting and haze in order to achieve this final image. Slight tweaks were made to contrast and conversion to mono for final presentation. _• The historic photographer of the year awards is a joint venture between two cultural brands, Trip Historic, the leading online travel guide to the world's historic sites, and History Hit, which brings unique content and insight from some of the UK's best known historians and academics.

A quiet winter morning after Chinese new year. I was strolling on the ruins of the Great Wall, built in 1680. I seemed to hear crossing swords and horses neighing

  * ## Richard Nash – Wells Cathedral, Somerset

  
This is the monument to Ralph of Shrewsbury, bishop of Bath and Wells (died 1363). It is a very finely carved alabaster monument that has had much graffiti carved into it over the years. Perhaps this shows how history changes our views on individuals. Ralph of Shrewsbury was clearly very highly regarded. How have the mighty fallen!

A colour infrared image of this battle site, whose name means ‘the wading-place of the river Went’. It was taken in the 70s, but it is only with the advent of modern software that the full beauty of the picture, and the data it holds, can become apparent. The crop mark near the bottom looks very like a Roman mansion, or posting station, alongside road M28b
