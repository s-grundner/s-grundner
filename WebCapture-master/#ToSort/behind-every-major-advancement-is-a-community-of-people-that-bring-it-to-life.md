In the mid 1990's, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia, and Toshiba formalized the creation of a wire replacement for communicating voice and data between devices. To ensure the standardization and interoperability of this short-range radio technology, the founding companies formed the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) in 1998.

Today there are more than 33,000 member companies dedicated to perfecting and advancing a flexible, reliable, and secure wireless connection solution.

The IoT for everyone. Everywhere.

In 2000, the first PC card and first mobile phone with _Bluetooth_Â® technology came to market. Today, phones, tablets, and PCs have become portals through which people experience every thing and every place. Bluetooth technology is the wireless constant in all of them, and the key to making IoT solutions accessible to everyone.

Like you've never experienced before.

The audio cable was one of the first cords Bluetooth cut. In 2003, the first MP3 player with Bluetooth technology was sold, and in 2012 the first Bluetooth Low Energy music players hit the market. Since then, Bluetooth has forever changed the way we consume media and experience the world.

Safer. In the moments that matter most.

In 2001, the first Bluetooth hands-free car kits were introduced. Since then, Bluetooth has brought new levels of safety to our roads and more convenience to the in-car experience. Bluetooth technology is now enabling exciting new use cases that increase fuel efficiency, protect drivers from the effects of fatigue, and better connect cars and drivers to the cities around them.

The Internet of Everything.

Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), introduced in 2010, powers the connected device market. By connecting billions of everyday devices and enabling the invention of countless more, Bluetooth technology is helping make the IoT vision a reality.

The Smart Building of Tomorrow. Today.

Bluetooth technology is making intelligent building automation at scale a reality and is expanding the definition of the smart building by enabling indoor positioning and location services that focus on enhancing the visitor experience, increasing occupant productivity, and optimizing space utilization.

Powering the Industrial IoT.

Bluetooth technology is leading a convergence of industry and information that paves the way for the next industrial revolution, creating intelligent machines and whole manufacturing lines that can predict and problem solve.

Connecting Where We Work, Live, and Play.

Bluetooth helps connect city infrastructures in ways never before imagined to enhance the visitor experience and improve the quality of life for citizens, businesses, and employees around the globe.

Right at Home in the Smart Home.

Whether connecting TVs to soundbars or PCs to keyboards, Bluetooth technology has been at the heart of the connected home for years. Bluetooth is now enabling automatic control of lights, thermostats, smoke detectors, cameras, door bells, locks, and more to deliver the promise of the smart home.

Thank you to our community of visionaries and inventors who have created revolutionary standards and innovative products that have established global markets, shaped culture, and improved lives.
