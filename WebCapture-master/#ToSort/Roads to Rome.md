### At least for Europe it is obvious: All roads lead to Rome! You can reach the eternal city from more than 3,3 million locations all over the continent. Which road would you take?

The saying "all roads lead to rome" might refer to a bronze monument built 20 BC called Miliarum Aureum (lat. "Golden Middlestone"). The Miliarum Aureum was used as a reference point for travelling through the Roman Empire. It was concidered, that all roads lead to this monument.

The outcome of this project is somewhere between information visualisation and data art, unveiling mobility and a very large scale. View and interactively explore all roads to rome and other cities.
