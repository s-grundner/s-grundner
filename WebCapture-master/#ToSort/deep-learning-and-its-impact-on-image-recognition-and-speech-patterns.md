Insight for I&O leaders on deploying AIOps platforms to enhance performance monitoring today. [Read the Guide](https://dzone.com/go?i=260321&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmc.com%2Fforms%2Fgartner-market-guide-for-aiops-platforms-2017.html%3Fcid%3Dpt-PA_STA_All_FC_PT_Gartner_AIOps_Market_Guide_Dzone_Analyst_Report-AB-03-f-08232017%26cc%3Dpt%26elqcid%3D4114%26sfcid%3D7011O0000027wFd).

Deep learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that permits software to train and perform -- all by itself -- tasks like speech recognition and image recognition. It has a lot of significance in various fields like medical diagnostics; robotics and a lot of innovations are currently being done to assure its superiority with real-time applications.

Deep Learning has been an important Artificial Intelligence technique that allows the computers to establish how to recognize the desired sentences, objects or words. It is visibly true that Deep Learning has suddenly started changing our lives with numerous modes of speech recognition functions that have been made available on our smartphones. These features typically help to increase our viable interactions by just talking to them in a common, understandable language. Some of the most dominant options are available with Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazons' Alexa, as well as the many voice-responsive features Google has tweaked. According to certain search giants data, it has been observed that users have nearly tripled with the usage of speech interface applications in the recent times. Interestingly, there have been many new innovations that are in progress in the recent years with respect to voice recognition.

## Some of the Most Important Impacts Deep Learning Has in Real-Time Environments

  * Some of the medical streams claim that they will be able to use computers to read MRI's, X-Rays, CT Scans, etc. significantly better than radiologists
  * Diagnosis of cancer and other chronic diseases becomes easier
  * Its impact is felt in self-driving cars, autonomous drones
  * Also being used in robotics to achieve major advances and improvements

Artificial Intelligence encompasses a vast range of technologies like traditional logic and rules-based that enable computers to solve problems that ensures something like supernatural thinking. Significantly and undoubtedly, deep learning is driving today's AI explosion. The recent advancements in neural networks have also made the machines wiser than humans as it easily identifies diseases and thus identifies tumors in MRI scans.

With the vast number of impounding Deep Learning uses and its high level of significance in real time, it is immensely important to partner with certain able service providers to take complete advantage of this technology. It is more so needed to partner with certain robust solutions like Edge IoT, which provides a perfect complement to make streaming data available as fast as possible to machine learning and analytical models. There are certain Advanced Data Analytics providers in the industry and leveraging their IoT solutions could deliver excellence in cloud-based processing that ensures business excellence. There are various Edge IoT Solutions readily available that helps deploy cloud services on a plethora of devices (POS system, IoT device, business outlets, etc.) allowing you to manage data effectively, run analytics, and gain business insights.
