Good_ morning on this cloud-shrouded Monday._

Happy leap day!

Feb. 29 is more like a catch-up day than a leap day, however, as the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson recently [told our Grace Notes columnist, James Barron](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/nyregion/a-former-calvin-klein-underwear-model-celebrates-a-unique-birthday.html).

That's because it takes the earth 365¼ days to orbit the sun, so a day is added to the Gregorian calendar every four years.

Well, not exactly.

It actually takes the earth a bit less than 365¼ days to travel around the sun, so one day is also dropped at the turn of every century, except when that year is divisible by 400.

(We know, math in the morning -- sorry.)

Not only have leap years balanced the calendar, they have also given Ireland its [ tradition of the so-called Ladies' Privilege](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/fashion/weddings/women-proposing-leap-year.html). That is, women proposing to men. (Whether it's a privilege is debatable.)

And about [200,000 Americans can](http://statistics.about.com/od/Applications/a/Leap-Day-Statistics.htm) celebrate their first real birthdays since 2012 today.

Locally, "[leapers" or "leaplings"](http://leapyearday.com/feb29/home) can take advantage of free-food [specials](http://pix11.com/2016/02/28/heres-where-to-score-the-best-deals-for-leap-day/).

Benefits for the rest of us include [leap-day shopping and travel deals](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/travel/hotel-and-resort-news-leap-year-deals-across-the-country.html).

And if we didn't have leap days, today would be [July 15, 2017](http://graphics.latimes.com/leap-year-2016/).

Better for the leaplings to stay forever young than for the rest of us to get older.

Here's what else is happening.

**WEATHER**

It's cloudy out there, but at least it's warm.

Expect a [high of 57](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&lon=-73.96940231323242#.VtQKD8rGKr3), with [showers](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.7766&lon=-73.9694&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=graphical) likely throughout the morning.

Nothing too daunting, but tuck that umbrella in your briefcase to play it safe.

**AND FINALLY … **

When was the last time you had the "Brooklyn boys" chasing you?

That expression, in 1920s New York, meant you were experiencing a nasty withdrawal from alcohol.

Back then, the city might have been dry (thanks to prohibition), but its vernacular was quite fluid.

In 1929, [The Times published](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04E6DD1130E73ABC4B52DFB6678382639EDE) a piece about words heard on the street.

The fashionable "wisecracks" of the "smart set" included "plastered" or "blotto" for drunkenness, and our favorite, "kibitzer," used to describe "anyone who attends to business other than his own."

"Making whoopee" and "bats in the belfry" were deemed passe phrases.

You can hear more old-time slang in the [Broadway revival of the Eugene O'Neill play "Hughie."](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/theater/review-in-hughie-with-forest-whitaker-two-desolate-lost-souls.html)

And [take our quiz](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/26/theater/hughie-eugene-oneill-new-york-slang-quiz.html) to see how much lingo you already know.
