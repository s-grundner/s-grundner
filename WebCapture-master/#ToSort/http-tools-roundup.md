At a conference a few days ago, I put up a slide with a few of my favorite tools on it. I got some brilliant additional recommendations in return from Twitter so I thought I'd collect them all in one place in case anyone is interested - all these tools are excellent for anyone working APIs (so that's everyone!). First, my original slide:

The starter set of tools looked like this:

  * [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) is the swiss-army command-line knife for all HTTP requests, and much, much more. It's kind of arcane but powerful and it's my tool of choice.
  * [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a brilliant command-line tool for handling JSON; I use it with curl and this talk was about [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) which speaks JSON for its data format so I had to mention it here!
  * [http-console](https://github.com/cloudhead/http-console) is a cross-platform interactive HTTP prompt, I like it and use it a lot with CouchDB particularly.
  * [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) is more like curl but humane and with gorgeous colorful output that makes everything easier to read! This _should_ be my favorite, but I have the muscle memory for curl.
  * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a cross-platform friendly graphical interface for making and inspecting HTTP requests. I usually recommend this to anyone who finds this a more approachable way to use a computer than from the command line. It's a very, very good tool and works on all platforms.

## Additional Suggestions

A bunch of really interesting tools went past on Twitter, so I'm adding them here in case anyone wants to check them out:

  * A popular (but not free) option for Mac users looking for a good GUI tool is [Paw](https://paw.cloud/client) \- suggested by [@freekmurze](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) and seconded by [@akrabat](https://twitter.com/akrabat).
  * There were a lot of recommendations for [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), an open source graphical HTTP client. Thanks to [@heiglandreas](https://twitter.com/heiglandreas), [@zot24](https://twitter.com/zot24) and [@wijzijnVannut](https://twitter.com/wijzijnVannut) for that one.
  * [http-prompt](https://github.com/eliangcs/http-prompt) is HTTPie (mentioned above) plus an interactive prompt which sounds great - suggestion comes from [@codeheaps](https://twitter.com/codeheaps).

What did we miss? Do you love or hate any of these tools? Answers in the comments please, I think it's great to be sharing our experiences of the apps we're using and what works for each of us!
