# The death of scripting

Back in the day, when programmers knew that they couldn't possibly think of everything somebody might want to do with a computer, there were scripts. If somebody could find enough of the _pieces_ of the thing that they wanted to do, they might be able to put them together themselves in furtherance of their task.

Many times, constructing these scripts was a lot like programming the software being glued together. On the Amiga there was ARexx, on the PC there were batch files, on Mac there was AppleScript: all programming in its own right, making new applications out of the ones you'd bought.

Applications. Here's the dichotomy. Think of two axes on a chart: one axis records the things you want to do with a computer; the tasks you want to complete. The other records the things you _can_ do with the computer: the applications to which it can be put.

These axes are not perpendicular, as if there is no projection into your tasks by your applications. But they are not parallel either. And where the directions taken by the applications are not progressing your tasks, in comes scripting to provide bridges between those applications and take you on your way.

Not all of these bridges are esoteric programming languages on top of other programming languages. NeXT had services, in which applications could publish menu items that became available in other applications where the two were using the same data. Apple took a bit from each column to make Automator, a UI in which you could snap together bits of applications to make your task.

All of this represented a helpfulness and humility on the part of the applications makers: we do not know everything you want to do. We do know some things you _might_ want to do: we'll let you combine them and mash them up - "rip, mix and burn" as they used to say - making you more satisfied and our stuff more useful.

Sadly all of this utility plays merry hell with branding. Applications aren't just utilities, they're icons in the launcher, splash screens, names in menu bars, reminders that I also make other applications and by the way have you rated this one five stars yet? Scripts stop people seeing that, they're too busy using their computers productively to see the marketing.

And so it's sad to see scripting die out as the popular platforms for application development fail to support it. Instead of the personal control of the script - I will take _this_ information from that app, and put _this_ part of it in that app - we have the corporate control of the API. This app maker and that app maker are BFFs, sign in here to let them share _everything_. After all, they know best.

Ultimately the death of scripting is hubristic. We know how you want to use a computer. If you're trying to do something that we didn't sell to you, you must be holding it wrong.
