Today, the White House announced a $200 million per year commitment to computer science education in America's schools. Unlike similar proposals in previous years, today's action delivers funding to schools, immediately. Besides expanding access to computer science in schools that previously didn't teach it, the funds promise to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities.

This funding will jumpstart efforts to ensure every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of a well-rounded education. For advocates of increased access and diversity in CS, this is the culmination of years of momentum that began in classrooms, spread to entire school districts, and won the support of business leaders and elected officials globally.

At a time when computing careers are the best-paying, fastest-growing, and largest sector of new wages, impacting every industry in every state, it is no longer acceptable for our schools to limit access to this foundational subject. Our children deserve a level playing field -- the opportunity to learn computer science shouldn't be limited by the color of a student's skin or the neighborhood she lives in.

The UK, Japan, Ireland, and a dozen other countries have announced plans to add computer science to their school curriculum. It is unacceptable for the U.S. to lag behind. The country that invented the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone should also lead in computer science.

And today, America leads in computer science, thanks to countless supporters of this cause, starting with you: parents, students, and teachers, as well as partner organizations and local governments. Whether you signed a petition on Code.org or used our courses in your classroom, you've helped build a grassroots movement that is changing education, globally.

**Uniting for children, in divided times**

The division in our country hurts us all. Amidst the politics, America's students represent our hope. We all want opportunity for our children, and there's no better way to offer them opportunity than to prepare them for the careers of the future.

This movement has supporters across the political spectrum, whether in urban, suburban, or rural communities. 90% of parents support computer science in schools.

Americans may be divided by our politics, but we're united by our dedication to our children. We all believe in opportunity and the American Dream.

Code.org has never endorsed any candidate, politician, or political party. We've worked closely with presidents and governors from both parties, and with international prime ministers, to advocate for opportunity. Like many others, we're appalled by the divisiveness in today's politics, at a time when we need collaborative solutions to the world's problems. Given our education focus, we're dismayed by proposed cuts to education budgets. And given our mission and focus on diversity, we unequivocally denounce the tone of racism that has entered the political sphere.

Today we have a chance to set aside politics and come together, to support opportunity for **all** our youth, and to build our nation's future.

**This is still the beginning**

For those of us who have spent years working to spread computer science, today's announcement marks a new beginning -- it's a new opportunity for every school to expand its computer science offerings. This work is only just beginning, and the job won't be done until every state and school district in America steps up to teach high-quality computer science.

To the 600,000 Code.org teachers who have helped make computer science the fastest-spreading subject in modern education, I want to thank you for your passion.

And I encourage every educator to consider [joining the computer science movement](https://code.org/yourschool). Your students are our future. Whether you teach your students to add and subtract, to read and write, or to code, yours is the most important job in the world.

Today marks a special moment for every parent, student, teacher, or partner organization who believes in our mission, that every student in every school deserves the opportunity to learn computer science.

To all of you who have supported Code.org, today's announcement is about something bigger than any politician or political agenda: it's about our children and their future, and it's about you, and the strength of our global movement for students. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

Hadi Partovi, Code.org
