# Caching Explained

Some people pulled out calculators to do the maths, and _finally_ someone yelled out the answer after a few seconds.

Then the speaker asked the _exact same question again._ This time everyone was able to immediately call out the answer.

This is a great demo of the concept of caching.

The initial time-consuming process was done once, then after that, when the same question was asked, the answer was readily available, and _delivered much faster._

When applied to the context of your website, this translates to the ability to deliver a webpage with a _super-fast response time_ without having to do all the time-consuming processing, every time the page loads.

The first visitor to a particular page on your site is "asking the question" and your server provides the answer. The next time a visitor goes to the same page, ie. "asks the same question", your server can provide the answer, i.e the web page, much faster.

When we are working on your website we will change the _code_ and when we do this we have then effectively _changed the question and therefore changed the answer._

The problem then arises that it is not so easy to convince a room full of people that the answer they knew before has now changed.

To add to our problems some of the people in the room have told other people the old answer. People that are not in the room that we have no control over.

What I mean by "other people" is that your own computer's browser will also save cache information and will continue to show your site from the previous version.

So this is the situation we have, where we have changed code on your website, confident we have completed work on the site, yet you may not be able to see any evidence of that work.

Refreshing the browser a few times can often be the solution but sometimes caching is stubborn and it may just be a case of waiting.

Can't we just turn it off?

Unfortunately the downside of caching is something we must tolerate; simply because the mild inconvenience of changes not being immediately visible is far out weighed by the increased speed and efficiency of your website and server.

So there we are, I hope that helped you to understand   
what caching is and how it affects what you see on websites.
