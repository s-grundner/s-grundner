Here is everything, which we are going to need:-

b. Strippers

c. Powerbank module, I got mine from aliexpress for around $1.50

d. 18650 cells you can savage these from old laptop battery of buy some

## Step 3: Soldering !

Once we have gathered all the materials   
first check the voltage of each cell if all are same then, start soldering 18650 cells in parallel

After soldering, fix cells together with the help of hot glue gun

After which solder the battery to the module and you should be able to use it

## Step 4: Need Case !

We need some kind of case, for that I used my tevo tarantula to 3D print one

Which I designed in fusion 360 You can find all my files below or else you can always use your own creativity to make one

## Step 5: Put Everything Together !
