Unlike most air-less tires that use a solid rubber composite tube, these tires actually do away with the tube itself, relying on a clever mix of design and physics to give you the airless tire! Bridgestone (the force behind these tires) has been experimenting with this concept since 2011, only recently demonstrating how effectively they could be [used in cars](http://icdn8.digitaltrends.com/image/tire-technology-npt-0001-1200x0.jpg). The wheels are made completely out of a recycled thermoplastic resin and are set to be available by no later than 2019.

Although I can't help but wonderâ€¦ imagine how psychedelic these will look while spinning!
