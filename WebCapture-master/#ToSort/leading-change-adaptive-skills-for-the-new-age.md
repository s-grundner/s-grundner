The pace of scientific and technological change is happening faster than people's ability to adapt. This sentiment is expressed by Eric "Astro" Teller, CEO of Google X, in Thomas Friedman's latest book, _[Thank You For Being Late](http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/thank-you-for-being-late/). _

Indeed, many people seem reluctant to change. Or, even if they are open to change, they don't know how to or they lack the necessary skills. Well-meaning leaders compound the problem by encouraging followers to embrace change, without backing up their exhortations with the necessary skills training to help people do so. That's akin to encouraging folks to build a house, but not providing them the necessary tools or materials. Frustration and failure are the inevitable results.

All this helps to explain why I've dedicated my career to helping people pick up the pace when it comes to change. Specifically, through my keynotes and books, I attempt to provide people the _individual_ skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a fast-changing and accelerating world at work and home. Many human resources departments and business schools offer courses on large-scale _organizational_ change management. But fewer seem to offer education on _individual,_ _self-change _management. And, in order to lead others through change, it seems to me you have to first learn to manage yourself.

So I recommend leaders equip themselves and others with an individual "change toolkit." Such a kit of tools -- or ways of thinking, feeling and behaving to get better results -- might include the following:

**1\. A rudimentary understanding of human behavior and what makes people tick.** Adapting to change means changing behavior to get different results. But changing behavior is hard -- if not impossible -- if you don't know what drives your behavior in the first place. So providing some basic knowledge of practical psychology and encouraging a modicum of self-awareness seems like a reasonable and necessary starting place to helping people successfully adapt to change.

**2\. A willingness to get comfortable being uncomfortable. **Psychological knowledge and self-awareness are necessary but not sufficient to drive sustainable change in behavior. People need be willing to step outside their comfort zone and try new approaches to old problems if they are to break free of old patterns. Inevitably, for many, this will feel uncomfortable at first. But, just as a physical workout designed to change the body often results in minor discomfort at first, so too with change. Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable is an essential early step to successful, self-change management.

**3\. Learning to let go of whatever is holding you down or holding you back.** It's hard to grasp new opportunities while holding on to old ways of thinking, feeling and behaving that may no longer be relevant in a fast-changing world. Learning to release the old to embrace the new, is often a difficult but always an essential step in the change process. Therefore, leaders need to create an environment where it is safe for people to try, fail and learn the new, as they learn to adapt by letting go of the old.

**4\. Latch on to values.** Some things should never change. Values fall in that category. Like a compass, values will point people in the right direction when change has them feeling lost and unsure of where to turn next. Successful leaders regularly rely on values to make difficult decisions driven by change. Absent daily use to make such decisions, and corporate values become nothing more than empty words on the wall. True change leaders refer to organizational values constantly and encourage individuals to reflect and rely on their own set of values as well. And, congruence between individual and corporate values is essential to building a sustainable, change-agile organization, so hire accordingly.

**5\. Use a "ToWho" list to build your change network.** Relationships are like shock absorbers: They help you stay grounded and adapt when change unexpectedly rocks your world. So build the relationships now that you will need then. A ToWho list can help you do that. It is a tool akin to the to-do list. But rather than a list of daily activities, the ToWho list is a list of all the people you want to stay in contact with, but may not have an immediate reason to do so right now. Successful leaders review and add to their ToWho list regularly, and encourage others to do the same. Reaching out to somebody on one's list is a great way to sustain the relationships that will sustain one most, both personally and professionally, whenever change hits.

**6\. Grow where you're planted. Find a way. No excuses.** Leaders don't complain about change. They are too busy doing something about it. Combining a resilient mindset with a healthy sense of self-deprecating humor, leaders send a message of "we got this" to their followers when facing difficult or unwanted change_._ True, leaders don't always like change, but they are determined to find a way through it. Their "grow where you're planted" mindset encourages and paves the way for others to do the same.

Bottom line: When leaders equip people at every level of their organization with the skills they need to thrive through change, the entire organization can move forward into the new age with a confidence born from preparation. And, learning to manage yourself as you seek to lead others is a great place to start.
