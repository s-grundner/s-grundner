Coding is vital to computers and IT. And I don't need to be a genius to say or know this. So, what is coding, and why does it occupy a position of such preeminence to this field? Simply put, coding is a set of commands that tells your computer to do what you want it to.

You could see it as something that is [told to](https://www.360psg.com/blog/why-learning-code-is-important) the computer in a language and way understands it. Since it is a machine, it needs exact prompts, commands and directions to do what you want it to. Carrying this out is what coding encompasses.

Coding is not a standalone function, because for the computer to do what you want it to do, it has to work in tandem with a number of other functions such as programming and scripting to optimize its uses.

Coding has emerged as an indispensable function of computer-related work. A person is no longer required to be technically sound and competent to take up or grow in the field of computers or IT. One can be good at coding even without these prerequisites. Realizing the importance of coding, a sizable number of online courses have been offering the vitals of coding to learners through online courses.

The highlight of these online courses is that one doesn't have to go and sit in a class at fixed, regular hours to learn and wait for the teacher to begin teaching. All that one needs is an interest in learning about coding.
