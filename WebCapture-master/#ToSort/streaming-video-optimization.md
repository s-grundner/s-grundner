Great to speak with Ryan Windham, CEO of [Cedexis](http://www.cedexis.com) about the general availability of streaming video Quality of Experience (QoE) tracking and analysis within its Radar Community -- the world's largest internet performance monitoring community.

Both global Quality of Service (QoS) and video QoE tracking and analysis are offered for free to organizations in the Radar Community. Cedexis is the first provider to provide companies with monitoring capabilities for both video and web performance for free all in a single solution to be more responsive to modern application infrastructure.

> "The Cedexis Radar Community is increasingly using video as part of their core web business, and it was only logical to expand our platform beyond websites and mobile applications to include Internet video," said Ryan. "Radar-participating websites and applications can now use the Cedexis Radar tag to collect performance metrics for any streaming video and correlate performance to the CDN or origin server that served them. This data is fundamental to real-time optimization of delivery, empowering video providers to thrill their viewers, reduce their traffic delivery costs, and build successful, profitable businesses."

Designed to align with newly-defined standards from the streaming video alliance, this revolutionary capability powers a platform that can uniquely deliver comprehensive monitoring and optimization for web content, streaming video, and dynamically generated content and applications within a single, cloud-based solution.

This is a comprehensive application development platform for monitoring and measurement of billions of downloads everyday for a performance map of the user experience (UX) from the edge, to content delivery networks (CDNs), to public and private clouds with:

  1. RUM data from the community.

  2. Passive measurement in real time.

  3. Synthetic monitoring and high-frequency polling of backend applications.

  4. Fusion open API that enables the ingestion of data from other sources.

The addition of video performance monitoring by Cedexis provides the most comprehensive view of a user's complete journey from website or app visit, to player download and then video viewing. This enables the insights needed to optimize end-user experience in real time, and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

Over time, Cedexis will be able to proactively prevent issues using algorithms that predict UX and prevent sub-optimal experiences.

> "For the most comprehensive view possible, streaming video providers need to monitor and track Internet QoS, so they can predictively identify and sidestep emerging network challenges; this helps augment their partnering, planning, and routing decisions with a clear picture of consumer QoE," said Andrew Marshall, Cedexis Director of Product Marketing. "We are now able to provide companies with a clear correlation between QoS metrics and QoE outcomes, empowering global streaming video providers to both enhance their consumer experience, and identify the right delivery partners to guarantee QoE on the most economical terms."

Any customer using multiple clouds and CDNs will benefit from the insights of the platform and the platform enables customers to keep their applications portable from hybrid to hyperscale like Facebook, LinkedIn, A&E Network, and Slack. All companies will be able to make real-time routing decisions to optimize the UX, reduce start failures, and rebuffering.
