Just one week to go to WWDC, the highlight of the year for iOS developers across the world. For now, here's a bunch of new on Swift 4, and more analysis of Google I/O.

## iOS 

The brilliant Erica Sadun brings us through [Five Easy Dispatch Tricks](http://ericasadun.com/2017/05/23/5-easy-dispatch-tricks/) that will make your concurrent code easier to follow.

I'm sure we'll be reading a lot more about Swift 4 very soon, but for now here's a good introduction into the changes for [Encoding and Decoding in Swift 4](https://medium.com/compileswift/encoding-and-decoding-in-swift-4-f82114897862). If working with JSON has been giving you headaches, this is the medicine you need. For a more complete view of what's new in Swift 4, check out [this guide from Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift4).

Have you ever wondered [Should Outlets Be Weak or Strong?](https://cocoacasts.com/should-outlets-be-weak-or-strong/) While you might follow Apple's recommendation and use strong, it's good to have an understanding of the differences.

Check out this guide on [How To Build a Table View With Collapsible Sections](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/ios-how-to-build-a-table-view-with-collapsible-sections-96badf3387d0), which continues from a previous article explaining how to adopt Protocols and MVVM with table views.

If you're an API developer, you really should read [Using @autoclosure When Designing Swift APIs](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/using-autoclosure-when-designing-swift-apis-67fe20a8b2e), which gives some excellent use cases and examples.

Some projects to check out:

  * [MarkdownView](https://github.com/keitaoouchi/MarkdownView): Markdown view for iOS.
  * [Hanson](https://github.com/blendle/Hanson): Lightweight observations and bindings in Swift. 
  * [swift-deep-linking](https://github.com/ijoshsmith/swift-deep-linking): A simple way to consume deep link URLs in a Swift app. 
  * [VNImageScanner](https://github.com/varun-naharia/VNImageScanner): A usable and simple camera component class united into a single UIView.

## Android 

Still trying to catch up on all the Google I/O news? Check out this [list of the most promising breakthroughs](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-most-promising-breakthroughs-from-google-i-o-2017-40d3accd42) from the event.

Joe Birch has done an exceptional job in [Exploring the New Android Architecture Components Library](https://medium.com/@hitherejoe/exploring-the-new-android-architecture-components-c33b15d89c23), announced at Google I/O a few weeks ago.

[The Improved Android Plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features/new-android-plugin.html), 3.0.0-alpha1 brings a number of improvements in performance and bug fixes. For those of us putting up with slow build times, it could be worth [migrating your project to this plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features/new-android-plugin-migration.html)â€¦ provided you're not in production, of course!

With all the news around Kotlin, you're bound to want to get your teeth into it. Here's how to [Integrate Kotlin Into Your Complex Android Project](https://medium.com/@manuelvicnt/kotlin-integrate-it-with-your-complex-android-project-dagger-mockito-a4c71a8f2574), including dealing with Dagger and Mockito.

Some projects to check out:

  * [MaterialShadows](https://github.com/harjot-oberai/MaterialShadows): A library for supporting convex material shadows. 
  * [EasyTransition](https://github.com/huzenan/EasyTransition): A light shared elements transition lib for Android. 

## General 

[The Science Behind Apps Going Viral](https://medium.com/@Appseecom/the-science-behind-apps-going-viral-42d4122d1a80) looks at examples like Instagram and Flappy Bird to help make sense of why some apps succeed where others fail.

Speaking of app success, Stephen Coyle examples [how much his app has earned](http://stephencoyle.net/appstore) after a year on the App Store.
