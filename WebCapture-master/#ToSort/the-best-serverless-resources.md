Serverless is by all means one of the fastest growing trends amongst developers and with good reason. It solves a lot of problems that traditional servers face, problems like the scalability or the ever-growing problem of high hosting bills.

The technology is new in the sense that it's only now available to the masses at a decent cost, but cloud computing like function as a service and backend as a service providers have been around for years, passing the test of time as a viable option for small developers to large-scale enterprise solutions.

While there a lot of benefits to switching to serverless technology I think that the biggest one might be the fact that your developers won't have to keep thinking about the infrastructure, server configuration, security concerns, updates, etc. Not worrying about what happens under the hood lets him concentrate on the business logic. A recent study pointed out that by going serverless you save an average of 4 developer workdays per month.

They say pictures are worth 1,000 words. Well, here's a little snapshot of what serverless is all about. And remember kids, sharing is caring.
