Software-defined architecture is the next big thing for networks, allowing companies to shift away from costly, inflexible hardware to more agile and adaptable solutions. Consider software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN), which some experts see as the natural replacement of multi-protocol label-switching (MPLS) solutions currently in use.

There's some justification for this position, since SD-WAN offers reduced costs and greater flexibility. But software-defined solutions come with their own issues, such as quality of service (QoS) enforcement challenges and lack of application monitoring. How do companies considering the switch to SD-WAN ensure they're armed with both complete context and total control?

## There's Strength in Software

While the software-defined market has gone through its share of hype, most solutions actually on the market have come out the other side relatively unscathed. SD-WAN is among them; as noted by [Biz Tech Magazine](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2016/12/6-advantages-software-defined-wan-implementation), this networking approach "offers both financial and operational benefits to organizations."

These benefits include:

  * Companies can add or remove bandwidth without disrupting network operations, since SD-WAN routers can combine multiple connections and all connections are defined by software protocols instead of hardware switches.
  * Traffic can be encrypted on the move, and administrators can segment traffic to contain a potential breach. Transparency also gets better thanks to available application monitoring solutions, which offer real-time activity reports.
  * Companies with multiple branch offices and networks often benefit from SD-WAN implementation, since these solutions make it possible to enforce business-wide QoS and security policies, effectively governing disparate networks under a single framework.
  * SD-WAN networks also help empower the next iteration of IT problem-solving and monitoring: Automation. By linking top-level security, provisioning and routing rules under a reliable SD-WAN, it's possible for companies to implement automated reporting and detection tools. This reduces the amount of repetitive work required by IT admins while simultaneously increasing accuracy.
  * MPLS solutions are expensive, since they rely on pricey hardware and companies must budget for regular maintenance along with eventual replacement. SD-WAN offerings leverage public internet connections at the edge of corporate networks and control them using software, in turn reducing both upfront investment costs and ongoing obligations.
  * While MPLS offerings typically include backup and disaster recovery solutions, the inherent multiplicity of SD-WAN connections makes it far more difficult for hackers or disasters to sideline software-defined solutions.

## SD-WAN Technology Challenges

While SD-WAN offers measurable benefits over traditional MPLS solutions, it's not a perfect technology. Common challenges of software-defined networks include:

### QoS Management

SD-WAN solutions are often used for VoIP and video calls since access to broad bandwidth pipelines provides reliable connections and reasonable call quality. The problem? Because SD-WAN is an edge technology, companies lack granular control over QoS. While some providers offer guaranteed QoS, what they really mean is selecting the best network path for calls--if all are equally bad, calls will still experience lag and jitter.

### Existing Implementations

New technologies often get pegged to replace existing solutions, and that's certainly the case for SD-WAN for MPLS. But the public-facing nature of WAN makes it a bad idea to toss existing MPLS immediately; this could hamper overall SD-WAN adoption while MPLS architecture is still working well.

### WAN Optimization

One key benefit of WAN solutions is the optimization of traffic flows, typically via compression. But high-density, high-security traffic offers little room for compression, making the case for SD-WAN difficult when existing solutions still perform adequately.

### Service-Level Agreements

Another challenge for SD-WAN adoption is pre-existing SLAs. If companies have already made agreements with MPLS or other network service providers, it may be cost prohibitive to break these agreements and implement software-defined solutions.

### Application Context

SD-WANs are ideal for managing network and application loads, but provide virtually no context about user interaction with these applications without additional application monitoring. It's a birds-eye view, ideal for getting the big picture but not so useful when it comes to per-user data.

## Improving SD-WAN

Put simply, SD-WANs lack context. This isn't surprising, since these networks are designed to offer broad, unifying strokes at a cheaper cost than MPLS. The problem? With user experience -- and therefore overall productivity -- now tied to the performance and security of mobile and web-based applications, SD-WAN networks that provide connections with no context can only go so far.

Ideally, companies need SD-WAN monitoring solutions capable of contextualizing application performance by monitoring both applications and their specific network paths. By combining better routing with real-time observation of end-user interactions, it's possible to see exactly where software-defined solutions are delivering on their promise of ROI and where more work is required.

SD-WANs offer marked improvement over MPLS networks in many areas, but they lack the ability to guarantee QoS and drill-down into the user experience--critical aspects of the digital-first user environment. By pairing software-defined technologies with SaaS-driven network and application monitoring platforms, however, it's possible to tap the benefits of SD-WAN without losing critical context.
