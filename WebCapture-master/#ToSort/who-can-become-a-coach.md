Imagine a rewarding career that allows you to set your own hours, be your own boss, and help others become the best version of themselves.

Sound too good to be true?

What I've just described is the life of a coach. No, not a sports coach motivating players on the field - a coach, motivating, collaborating and supporting people to live fulfilling lives.

So, who can become a coach?

If you have a talent, skill or expertise to share with your clients AND you are naturally supportive and empathic, becoming a coach could be a great career change for you.

In this article, I'm going to share with you the steps it takes to become a coach and focus on a specific niche like entrepreneurship, mindset or even writing, I'll give you everything you need to know to get started.

## What's it Like to Be a Coach?

First, let's talk about what a coach actually is. Coaches actively listen to their clients as they discuss their desires, goals and hurdles. They motivate, collaborate and offer advice to help their clients move past their blocks and forward to their goals.

Unlike therapy, coaches don't focus on the past or attempt to heal psychological wounds. Instead, coaches are action-oriented, always asking the question "what step can you take today to take you closer to your goal?"

Many times, people seek coaches because they know something isn't right with their life, but they need help defining what it is. Coaches help clients answer these questions by inspiring them to discover their passions and live authentic, fulfilling lives.

One of the most exciting parts of a coaches' business is choosing _how and who_ they coach.

Let's take a look at a couple unique coaches and how they have chosen to approach their coaching business.

**Emily, creative business coach**

Emily, a graphic designer, quit her corporate job 5 years ago and started freelancing. Other creative individuals are always asking her for business advice. "How can I start freelancing like you?"

She decided to become a creative business coach, helping other creatives discover their true calling, refine their creative skills, and take small steps every day to start their creative business.

Because Emily loves to travel and knows several languages, she has created a series of online programs, reaching out to her clients around the world from wherever she's at on the globe at the time.

**Sally, mindfulness coach**

Sally's career skyrocketed 10 years ago, and so did her stress levels. She began practicing mindfulness meditation, and it changed her life. She loves sharing her story with others, and people often ask her how she stays so calm, while being so busy. So she decided to start a mindfulness coaching business to help other successful women learn how to use mindfulness.

Part of Sally's program is reconnecting with nature. She believes it's vital for your health to be outside as much as possible and to connect with other living creatures as much as possible too.

While Sally helps many clients through her online courses, she also has in-person clients, and for those, she conducts her coaching sessions outside. Several times a year she also holds retreats for her clients at a local animal rehabilitation center near her home.

## What Type of Skills Do You Need to Become a Coach?

Above all else, coaches have a burning desire to help others. They are compassionate, open minded and operate from a place of integrity.

Do the qualities below describe you? If so, you'd make a great coach!

  * An active, empathic listener
  * A compassionate curiosity about others
  * An interest in personal development
  * A clear communicator
  * Entrepreneurial skills like organization, confidence and determination
  * Personal integrity and honesty
  * Creative, strategic thinking

## Steps to Becoming a Coach

Now that you see how fulfilling, freeing and fun coaching can be, let's take a look at the steps you'll have to follow if you want to be a coach.

**Step 1: Decide on a Coaching Niche. **

Many coaches simply call themselves a life coach, however as there are so many life coaches already in existence, failing to specialise can be detrimental. Choose a speciality niche and a specific group of people you can help the most.

Choosing a niche helps you build a focused business and find clients that are looking for exactly what you have to offer.

Imagine someone is looking for help with their career. Maybe they've been successful at a certain job, but they don't find it fulfilling, and they want to make a switch, but don't know where to begin. This person could work with different types of coaches and find success, but imagine how thrilled they would be to find a career coach that specializes in helping others find the right career fit.

> _Specializing in a niche doesn't just draw in the right clients, it inspires trust and loyalty. _

So how do you know what niche to choose? The answer can be found by asking yourself 3 questions.

  * What do I love to do?
  * What areas do I have skills, expertise or talents in?
  * What topics do I know more about than 90% of the general population?

> _The perfect niche for you is found at the intersection of your interests, your knowledge and your skills._

**Step 2: Get Certified**

You don't have to have a certification to operate a coaching business, but it is enormously helpful.

A certification means you've completed training to become a coach, and you've learned the necessary skills and techniques that it takes to work with clients.

There are many certification programs out there, but it's important to invest in a well-rounded one that will teach you how to be the best coach you can be.

Coaching requires confidence, and if you open your coaching business and feel insecure, you'll struggle to find success. The best way to avoid that uncomfortable scenario is to build your confidence on a solid foundation by getting certified.

Most coaching certification programs only teach you the very basic coaching skills. While these skills are helpful, there's a whole set of tools that you'll miss out on if you invest in a traditional program.

The Coaching Mastery Certification program is the only one of its kind to teach you not just coaching skills, but mentoring, consulting and teaching skills too. As you start working with clients, you'll quickly discover how invaluable those skills can be.

**Step 3: Build Business Mastery**

To open a coaching business, you'll first need to learn how to attract clients. Your business relies on their investment, so it's important for you to invest in learning the skills needed to draw them in, engage them, and keep them coming back for more.

To do this, you'll need to create valuable content that's like a magnet for your ideal client, which is far more involved than just writing a few blog posts here and there.

You'll want to take potential clients on a journey of discovery, empowering and encouraging them along the way.

This type of marketing is a definitely a skill, but it's one you can learn. And there's certainly a lot to learn.

There's also a lot of advice out there about how to start a business and attract customers. All that information can be overwhelming, and oftentimes contradictory.

And to add on to all of that, the market is constantly changing. Marketing techniques that worked 5 years ago are no longer relevant, and how you reach clients and engage a community is constantly evolving and growing.

Instead of struggling to find the right answers, the best thing you can do is learn how to build a structured business that's set up to draw in consistent income.

That's why I created the Business Mastery Certification, which breaks down how to set up your business to succeed and grow-step-by-step. Learn more about Business Mastery Cetrification [here](http://www.businessmasterycertification.com).

## Final Thoughts

Coaching can be an empowering experience, not only for your clients, but for you!

Taking charge of your life - your income, your business, your goals - all while keeping focused on your values and helping others is an experience like no other.

The benefits are innumerable and span across every part of your life.

Butâ€¦ it's going to take some work. Everything of real value requires some investment, and becoming a coach isn't any different.

Once you put in the work, the pay off is huge.

What do you think? Do you have what it takes to be a coach?
