#### It's ironically easier to step down than it is to climb up.

Imagine you're walking up the side of a mountain. The cool breeze is tingling the perspiration accumulating on your face while your hands begin to burn from carrying a coarse heavy sack filled with all your _shit_. Life's pile of crap. Tons of it. You continue thinking, "Why am I carrying all this _shit_ that I don't even want!"

But, there you are.

Fiddling it from shoulder to shoulder then turning around, using your back muscles to pull it along with you- higher and higher. Exhausting.

You look up and quint your eyes at the bright, admiring, beckoning sun light illuminating the top of the mountain. It is glorious. You need to be there. Only if it wasn't for this huge pile of crap you're forcing yourself to carry. If only there was a way to eliminate some of this load. Then, it would be easier to tackle this mountain and make it all the way to the top.

Recently, I volunteered as a venting sponge for a friend of mine and was asked, _"Tanya, how did you get over [that] so fast?"_ I am nothing like a peace guru or anything. Although, those who have been close to me for a long time know that I have been through quite a lot. So, I sat there in silence for a minute thinking about my past and hardest obstacles. I didn't want to answer her like there is a magic potion that fixes all your problems. There isn't, and the realist truth is not all that comforting.

Life will always be stressful, and it continuously ranges in high to lows- usually without any warning. Not a very pretty sentence to read, I know. However, there is a little bit of _fairytale_ sprinkled right over it:

It is up to **you** and** your mindset **whether you brutally fall- face first- from life's punches or you dodge them swiftly and continue carrying your own weight.

**You must focus on gaining the mindset:**

### **To STAY busy and FORCE yourself to do things you may not _FEEL_ like doing.**

There is it. So simple right? Well, this "mind over matter" attitude takes practice. Especially, when our emotions are playing a big role. You have to become a realist when going through tough times. You must ask yourself: **_How can I utilize what I am going through, with my skills, my interests, and my time, to overall benefit me?_**

Each one of life's punches comes from a different angle, force, and speed. Some of us are carrying a sack of financial, relationship, work, health, family or more problems. We must acquire a new mindset that will not let life circumstances keep us from making it to the top.

**_This list below helps me achieve faster results while working through my problems, and getting over certain situations._**

### **Absorb more information.**

Our lovely Medium platform is great, News App for the iPhone does wonders, and twitter gives you updates within only 140 characters. Hey, even the old fashion newspaper is great if that suits your fancy. Point is: _Get your mind wrapped around what's going on in the world of topics you don't specialize in, or perhaps have had an interest in before._ Animals, Space, Human rights, Sports, Politics, Technology, Top selling novels- the topics are endless. For example, don't own or care to own your own business? Read up on start-ups, and gain knowledge about the ins and outs, or new and rapidly growing companies out there. Great resources for example: [twitter](https://apple.news/Ary3fXQpoTpO_Dc52cVYeJQ), [growth](https://apple.news/Ak7mLaT6HNBm-KSUNofNMBA), [snapchat](https://apple.news/AIoBKwrApMWKKz7eSczA0Fw), [sharing is caring](https://apple.news/AVbiaLi03MJ2mNUINpRt_uA). Grow your mind, dammit!

### A Change of Scenery.

Many people take advantage of traveling as a quick getaway from their problems. Although, I have nothing against this- sometimes our income doesn't give all of us that luxury whenever we want. That's why I suggest an aesthetic change closer to home. _Pick one thing to focus on and make it your own mini project._ My suggestion: Rearrange one room in your home, plant a garden, re-do your business card, volunteer to help clean a park, pick a new hair style, improve your work wardrobe, hike to an ideal destination. Make it new again, or be around something beautiful. You can get a change of scenery without bending the bank, and it will be good for your soul. Ahh.

### Add a workout to your routine.

If you're already a beast in the gym, or just keeping a membership for motivation- it's time to step it up a notch. It could be taking the stairs instead of an elevator, going for a walk every morning, giving into 5am workouts, or begin training for that 5k. Really whatever! Seek a physical challenge for the next week, and then seek another the next. Switch it up- you may find something that you love. _My suggestion:_ Kickboxing. Especially if you are going through life frustrations, or have pain from a certain situation. We need that opportunity to get that aggression out in a healthy way. Buy some gloves, and go hit the bag at your gym. Literally.

### Show a little love.

It feels good to give. Be creative and think of little ways to make others smile. Come across a great article? Send it to someone who might enjoy it. Bring a fun snack to the next meeting. Surprise your friend with that bracelet they loved while window shopping with you. Volunteer at an animal shelter or retirement home. Leave a nice note for a loved one. Make cookies with your child/youngest sibling for their homeroom class. Give a compliment to a stranger. Whatever fits. It's the little things that count and all it takes to put a smile on someone's face.

### **Try a new activity.**

It maybe something you haven't done in a while, or something you want to try for the first time. Maybe you haven't had the time or you think it's just been way too long. Now is the time to _make_ it the time. Find a group, class, or grab a friend and set a date. Then, go! I am extremist, so either I'm going to be an adrenaline junkie that day, or a boho yogi on the beach. My suggestions: Hit the slopes, race on dirt bikes, play on water, go rock climbing, buy tickets for a music festival, try fly fishing, really anything outdoors is my go-to recommendation.

### Suck the Poison out.

Sometimes, it seems impossible to make amends with the people in our lives, who many times- we can't avoid. So, we must be the bigger person and accept people for who they are. With that being said, you can still win by putting your pride aside. Apologizing when you did nothing wrong or stepping aside during an conflict at work is not a sign of weakness. It is understanding that your energy should be placed elsewhere. Do all you can to resolve the problems that are within your control and watch more weight fall off your shoulders. Grin and bare it ladies and gents.

### Draw out your vision.

Write a list of career and personal goals you'd like to achieve. The sky is the limit. Add a new hobby, or event to your schedule. Look up networking, or social events coming up in your area. Add a gym class to your weekly routine. Make a plan and execute it. Use your time wisely. Manage your time to accommodate your new add-ons. Also, _be committed to yourself and this schedule_. That's the most important thing. My suggestion: Make a vision board that goes along with this list. Make cut outs from magazines, or print inspiration from the internet. Stick to your passion, and follow it.
