With more companies relying on big data for marketing, the ability to analyze information and deploy engaging content in real-time is becoming an indispensable part of daily business. This requires universal access to analytics and content management both in the office and on the go. The expansion of 4G networks into more areas is making this vision a reality with better connectivity for businesses and consumers.

## **The Need for Speed**

Until recently, most cellular networks couldn't offer the bandwidth or speed required to meet the demands of companies and their customers. Despite this, [71 percent](https://datafloq.com/read/on-the-go-big-data-requires-a-different-approach-f/208) of mobile users expect pages to load as quickly over a data connection as when they're connected to Wi-Fi. Average mobile data consumption has grown into the realm of gigabytes instead of megabytes, meaning that consumers are now doing more with their cell phones and tablets than ever before -- and they want every moment to count.

Companies dealing in data are already familiar with the fact that content delivery is all about the customer experience. With 4G networks being rolled out in more and more areas, it's becoming possible to upgrade mobile content from simple text and images to robust, interactive advertising that includes audio and video.

## **The Age of Rich Mobile Content**

Delivering content that increases mobile engagement is part of what drives data collection in the first place. The power of a 4G network can be harnessed to see not only how many people are consuming content but also the context in which they're discovering it. This helps companies determine the [prevailing patterns of intent](http://www.informationweek.com/business/whats-next-for-4g-data-analysis/d/d-id/1107165?) among their customers and use the resulting information to create more targeted advertising campaigns.

Successful advertising in the modern market requires the kind of in-depth knowledge of customer demographics that only 4G can offer. By tapping into the abilities of these networks, it's possible to discover the [types of devices](http://www.polystar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Monetising-Customer-Insights-the-importance-of-big-data-analytics-in-4G-LTE-networks-FINAL.pdf) consumers are using, their behaviors regarding content consumption, and what apps they enjoy most. This information allows companies to break markets down into smaller subsets that display similar preferences and deliver exactly the type of content they're looking for.

## **Waiting for the Technology**

Companies looking to take advantage of 4G to deliver content and analyze data may have to wait a little longer. The infrastructure required to support such lightning-fast speeds can be difficult to put in place, and the greatest advances in the technology have yet to be realized. In the future, businesses may be able to use machine-to-machine (M2M) communications to track and record even more information about consumers, the popularity of products and the efficiency of fulfillment to deliver a customer experience unlike any that was possible in the past.

As 4G technology expands around the world, more businesses will start leveraging big data expand their reach, grow their customer bases, and increase profits. From deploying richer content to obtaining detailed real-time reports, having 4G broadband on your work phone can help you succeed in the modern market.
