Robots are great in general, and [taylor] is currently working on something a bit unusual: [a 3D printed explorer robot to autonomously follow outdoor trails](http://reboot.love/t/rover-a-robot-you-can-make-at-home/94), named Rover. Rover is still under development, and [taylor] recently completed the drive system and body designs, all shared via OnShape.

Rover has 3D printed 4.3:1 reduction planetary gearboxes embedded into each wheel, with off the shelf bearings and brushless motors. A Raspberry Pi sits in the driver's seat, and the goal is to use a version of [NVIDA's TrailNet](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Jetson/redtail) framework for GPS-free navigation of paths. As a result, [taylor] hopes to end up with a robotic "trail buddy" that can be made with off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts.

Moving the motors and gearboxes into the wheels themselves makes for a very small main body to the robot, and it's more than a bit strange to see the wheel spinning _opposite_ to the wheel's hub. Check out the video showcasing the latest development of the wheels, embedded below.

[taylor] has [an image gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/7jacQ) of the current hardware to go with the video above. Robots whose primary purpose is exploration are always exciting to see; some examples include [PUFFER](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/08/puffer-a-smartphone-sized-planetary-explorer/) the rover and the [Autonomous Underwater Glider](https://hackaday.io/project/20458-open-source-underwater-glider) (winner of the 2017 Hackaday Prize!)
