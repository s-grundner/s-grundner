# Physicists are hiding a dark secret behind murky language

Science seems solid and verifiable, reliable, practical, and nothing like an
abstract art. Yet [developments in physics](https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics
/cern-finds-four-new-x-particles-how-big-a-deal-is-this) seem totally opaque,
as easily explained as a Mark Rothko painting, right? It's fine to admit
ignorance. This happens to physicists too.

There are "perfectly understandable reasons" physicists don't always
understand each other, says [David
Kaiser](http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/DKResearch.html#Bio), an MIT professor
of physics and history of science. In 1937, everyone in the field understood
what you meant if you said you were getting a Ph.D. in physics. But already by
1948, increased specialization made it so even physicists didn't understand
the extent of the "physics" field. In the first issue of Physics Today, an
editorialist expressed dismay that the field was becoming incomprehensible,
obscure even to practitioners.

In his 2012 study on specialization proliferation, published by the [History
of Science Society](http://hssonline.org/), Kaiser attributes this phenomenon
to a boom in [graduate studies](http://qz.com/547641/theres-an-awful-cost-to-
getting-a-phd-that-no-one-talks-about/) in the US after World War II. This led
to micro-specialization, a trend that continues today. He told Quartz that his
colleagues joke "more and more, we need to know more and more about less and
less, ultimately knowing nothing about anything."

In 1964, Samuel Goudsmit, the editor of the journal Physics Review Letter,
suggested obscurantism wasn't accidental. Scientists are unclear, he wrote,
because they don't want to be understood, using language to obfuscate rather
than communicate. Goudsmit believed this was a painful secret hidden even to
scientists themselves. "It is the common subconscious fear of exposing oneself
to scrutiny," Goudsmit wrote. "If a paper is too clear, it might be too easy
for readers to see through it and discover its weakness."

Kaiser, however, takes a kinder view. He doesn't attribute obscurantism to
fear, like Goudsmit, or a psychological defect, [as does the Physics Central
blog Physics Buzz](http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2016/10/your-friday-
reading-obscurantism.html). Instead, he says, the incomprehensibility of
physicists is inevitable under the circumstances. Today more than ever, they
are under pressure to find a niche in which to excel. All may dream of
becoming the next Albert Einstein but in a field crowded with geniuses working
on esoteric research, none are likely to replace him as the face of physics on
t-shirts. More importantly, with so many researchers working on micro-
specialties, Kaiser says it's impossible for scientists to track and
understand all of the developments today, and as a result really benefit from
them.

To alleviate the stress, physicists have a laugh at their own expense. Kaiser
and his colleagues play a game called [SnarXive vs. ArXive](http://snarxiv.org
/vs-arxiv/), guessing if titles of scientific articles are real or
fake--[ArXive is an online record](https://arxiv.org/) of papers published in
scientific journals, relied upon by researchers, while SnarXive is, well,
[snarkier](http://davidsd.org/2010/03/the-snarxiv/). The game spits out
article titles using artificial intelligence following the rules of context
free grammar, like [computer-generated mad libs](http://davidsd.org/2010/03
/the-snarxiv/).

The right answers are rarely obvious, not even to Kaiser. He guesses wrong
sometimes, and says that physicists feel like the rest of us, befuddled. But
everything is relative (Einstein pun intended). "Context matters a lot,"
Kaiser reminds. In Einstein's time his ideas probably also seemed obscure and
impenetrable to many fellow physicists and the general population. Today those
notions are basic physics. "It's hard to know on an absolute scale what we
know."

Still, we can all take solace in the Socratic wisdom that the wisest among us
know only that we know nothing.
