iOS is an operating system which has successfully created fascination world-wide. This fascination and spell-binding impact must have looked day and night hard-work for iOS app developers. This hardwork is in the form of programming languages that are quite arduous for iOS app developers to learn. Objective-C defines that period when Apple had taken over the lost ground from Windows. Designed by Brad Cox and Tom Love influenced by C and Smalltalk, ensured its presence in the year 1983. Objective-C has catered to iOS app developers as well as users to create the magnificent impact till the advent of Swift in the year **WWDC 2014** event. Swift although considered to be the fast yet safe and interactive OS X programming platform, which although belonged to the paradigm to object-oriented, functional, imperative and block structured. It was created under the influence by Objective-C, Ruby, Scala and C #. This can be explained with the help of a beautiful and explanatory by **[Visual.ly**](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/technology/objective-c-vs-apple-swift-infographic)**.**

But do you think that these are the sufficient reasons of formation as well as learning of a new programming language, leaving behind those 34 years of programming language? Then following are the reasons which have made the iOS app developers to incline in favour of Swift.

**Difference of attributes: Swift vs Objective-C performance**

**Paradigm**

Swift with Object-oriented, block structured, imperative yet functional characteristics gave a tough fight to Objective-C which was 100% class-based object oriented. The intensity of competition can be easily judged while utilising Swift and Objective-C simultaneously. Due to this heavy paradigm of Objective-C, optimisation and changes was not easily tested which is although quite contrasting to Swift.

**Difference of Features**

According to [Apple Inc.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) Objective-C, a primary programming language is a superset of the programming language which provides object-oriented capabilities with dynamic run time. Analogously Apple considers Swift to be powerful yet intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, AND tvOS.

Features of Objective-C

  * Classes are object
  * Dynamic Typing
  * Optional Static typing
  * Expressive Messaging syntax
  * Introspection
  * Automatic garbage collection
  * Simplicity
  * Access to Apple Technologies

Features of Swift

  * Design for safety
  * Fast and powerful
  * Closures
  * Generics
  * Interactive
  * Type Interferences
  * Namespaces
  * Multiple return types
  * Objective-C interoperability
  * Syntax improvement

**Difference of coding**

The main difference between Objective-C and Swift is to provide a convenient, simple yet more flexible programming language as far as coding is concerned than Objective-c. The biggest complaint from iOS app developers received so far is the difficulty to handle coding in part of Objective-C which is quite contrasting with Swift. With the feature of easy maintenance, and resembling English language, 77.6% developers around the global has preferred Swift over Objective-C as far as iOS app development is concerned, as per **Stack Overflow Survey** among developers.

Hence code lengths in case of Swift is comparatively smaller while Objective-C looks for extensive coding.

What coding Objective-C follows?

  * Semicolons required
  * Header files
  * Type must be declared
  * Alloc and init
  * Pointer
  * KVO and custom setters

What coding Swift follows?

  * Closures
  * Generics
  * Multiple return types
  * Namespaces
  * Type interference

**String**

Considering **Computer Science**, a string is defined as the finite sequence of characteristics. The string of Objective-C programming language is represented by using NSString as well as its subclass **NSmutableString** renders several ways in order to create string objects. The simplest way is utilising @.

In Swift, strings are the improvement over Objective-C. It does not let the iOS app developers to worry about mutable or immutable string type. It provides the support of full Unicode character set and can be brought into use in switch statement.

**Functional Programming**

In Swift, unchanged files are recompiled which leads to the reduction of Execution Time. Hence it adopts functional programming with ease. It renders for support to various functions which includes high-order, value, embedded, anonymous with advanced iterators and mappers.

While Objective-C is considered to be pretty much time consuming since it needs to build complete code every time, in case of any changes are made to the code. Another factor which makes functional programming cumbersome, is its less capability to incorporate as it looks for instant variables.

**Conclusion**

With so many advantages inclined in favour of Swift, both the programming languages use the same runtime. But both the languages can be used in parallel while considering some particular rules. Swift compatibility with Objective-C enables to create a project written in any of the languages.

Although, Swift has made the life of **[iOS app developers**](https://www.fluper.com/ios-application-development) quite light but Objective-C still possesses same magnificence to create the most distinct iOS apps.
