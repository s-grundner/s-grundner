It doesn't matter whether you already apply DevOps in development or just think over such an opportunity, you should be aware of the latest trends in this sphere to make right decisions. There is no reason to use outdated technologies when the more advanced ones are available, right? That's the point why we decided to discuss the latest trends in the DevOps industry.

Except for trends, we'll figure out some major DevOps pitfalls waiting for companies which want to adopt this approach, as well as tell you why they fail in doing this.

## DevOps Trends to Be Aware of in 2018

The realization of DevOps is a good idea anyway. However, the tools and techniques that were used last year can be archaic nowadays. That's the reasons why we propose you to dive deep into DevOps trends which help to enhance the software development process.

### #1. Use of Docker

There is no more effective tool than Docker when it comes to the process of containerization. And that's the reason why DevOps community loves it. Docker helps to facilitate the stage of app development along with configuration management. Another advantage of this tool is that it gets better all the time. One of the recent updates brought the support of a native Kubernetes to this tool. This means that now you can use cloud-agnostic containers and stop spending your time and money on different PaaS systems to make use of their infrastructure and environment.

### #2. Self-Maintaining Processes

The Kubernetes open source project makes it possible to restore all the data from a container in seconds. In other words, users can be completely sure that if any failure happens, their information can be easily restored. What's more, the system will send you a report concerning that issue so you could prevent it in future.

### #3. Automation

Automation is probably the core principle of DevOps approach and this trend will never lose its relevance. The process of automation allows you to get away from manual testing. This type of testing isn't only time-consuming but 'consumes' a lot of resources. Of course, there are a plethora of QA engineers who defend manual testing saying that automated unit testing is a tiresome and daunting process. In spite of this, automation is the only choice that fits a long-term perspective as it saves a lot of time. Especially if take into account that you can use test units more than one time.

### #4. Agile

Nowadays, agile software development is one of the most popular approaches. At the same time, it's hard to find a team who uses it in its initial form. Well, DevOps intends to change that and get us back to where it all started. The thing is that DevOps can be successfully utilized only in the environment which is flexible enough. So you better reread the Agile Manifesto in case you've forgotten what the true Agile approach really means.

### #5. Metrics

It's a very important point since it's not enough just to implement DevOps, you have to learn the impact of its implementations. Is it getting better, worse or stand still? In other words, this trends is about efficiency and how to track it. The companies using the DevOps approach use a variety of tools to estimate the impact of DevOps on their teams.

### #6. Serverless Computing

Serverless system isn't just a dream but reality with the use of right solutions for the DevOps. With their help, the infrastructure will cost you nothing and you will be able to focus on the development process itself. Such computing model gradually becomes the grounding for a new industry's area -- Function as a Service.

### #7. Big Data

The application of DevOps to the software development process generates a big scope of data that should be processed. Machine learning is the most effective way to handle this task. Even though such approach to data analysis leads to additional expenses, it can become a strong tools helping you to measure the strengths and weaknesses of your DevOps approach.

### #8. Use of Advanced Technologies

The market is filled with a variety of DevOps tools and plugins. What's more, the new ones appear each day. If you want to be up to date in this competitive market you have to analyze all these solutions, measure their performance, and use them if it's required.

Don't know where to start? Underneath, you can see several capabilities you should focus on to be sure that you are on the right way:

  * Staging environment for software development;
  * Collaborative coding support;
  * Infrastructure as a Code support;
  * Help with continuous integration;
  * Automated testing along with deployment;
  * Feature for problem tracking.

## Getting Ready With DevOps

Now, you are aware of the top market trends which means it's high time to consider the further steps to take. Underneath you see the main steps you should be ready to.

### Infrastructure as Code

In case you don't understand what the phrase above means, take your time and figure it out as it's the key to DevOps approach. IaC means that you should treat operations environment in a way you do with apps and other code for release. Simply put, you should forget about changing configuration and adjustment manually and follow the same rules you use to manage the development of a code.

### Testers Should Code

Each QA engineer working in your company should be able to write code in order to perform [automated testing](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/software-testing-services--difference-between-basic-and-advanced), as well as automated deployment which is also a fundamental of DevOps approach. This way, if your QA engineers can test only manually, you should consider some ways to enhance their skills or hire new talents.

### PaaS Is No Longer Needed

These outdated systems slow down your progress. You need to move in a direction to platforms with container structure. By taking this step, you will be more flexible in terms of further development.

In case you have already shifted to the use of containers you can experiment in order to benefit even more from their usage. Think of possible ways how to utilize them in production.

### See the Whole Picture

Consider the whole ecosystem as one single organism. Remember that there are some problems which can't be solved with the help of code. So, you should consider all the peculiarities (e.g. database, hardware etc.)

## Reasons DevOps Fails

No doubts, the DevOps approach is a good fit for the software development. However, many companies fail in their attempts to implement it. Let's take a look at several common mistakes and how to avoid them.

### You're in a Hurry

DevOps software engineering practice is something that can change your business processes for the best. We understand that it's beneficial to both a company and its developers, so you will probably want to implement it as soon as possible. However, by setting extremely tight deadlines and telling your team that starting from tomorrow the company will follow the DevOps principles you won't make them work in your favor.

You need a plan. First, assess the level of expertise that you and your team have in the DevOps methodology. Then, answer these questions:

  * Are you and your team ready to utilize DevOps tools?
  * Are you and your team ready to adopt automated testing?

If you aren't ready, then probably it's a good idea to hire a remote or in-house DevOps engineer.

### You Ignore the Matter of Quality

Nowadays, most of the development teams focus heavily on the speed of delivering a product they work on. No doubts, the speed of development is very important but the final product's quality is not a less important factor. The use of DevOps approach implies fast development process along with high quality of final product. In case you made a decision to adopt this approach, you should use the best techniques and tools. This way, you'll be able to deliver products of high quality and develop them fast.

### You Run Tests in a Wrong Way

This tip can help you to cut the development time. Some DevOps specialists think that tests should be run asynchronously and they consider it as a more productive way of testing. That's not exactly true. The order of running tests affects only on time. So, if you execute tests automatically and synchronously -- you're on the right path.

### You Don't See the Final Goal

It's not easy to find the right path without clear goals. DevOps has many things in common with Agile. For example, if the main purpose isn't clear to each team member -- the project can fail. Your main goal is to make sure that each of them sees the set goal clearly.

Sometimes the shift to the DevOps approach requires adaptation of new techniques in management. Besides, you should advance your production system all the time, as well as get rid of the barriers between department in your company.

Surely, the implementation of DevOps can be difficult and take a lot of resources including the financial ones. However, it will make your company only stronger. In case you are not sure concerning how to rebuild your company's workflow -- hire in-house or remote DevOps engineer. This will save you a lot of time and prevent the waste of money.
