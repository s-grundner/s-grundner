# See just how complicated the Tesla Model S door handle is

A traditional door handle is a simple lever, but on the [Tesla Model S](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/auto/2016-tesla-model-s/review/), it's an intricate ballet of moving parts. Thanks to one curious auto writer, we can see exactly how it works.

Bozi Tatarevic, a freelance auto writer and general car-parts nerd, posted a YouTube video that offers up some serious details about the inner workings of the Model S door handle. Using a door handle he sourced from a junkyard for $30 (the assembly retails new for just under $800), he shows how the whole shebang works.

His attention to detail is staggering. Not only does he take it apart, but he also goes into detail on its operation -- how it's able to extend when you're walking up, or how it can extend when you give it a little push. He even broke it down to individual components, like the microswitches ([Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Panasonic-Industrial-Devices/ASQ10410/?qs=2rFUEsTwVNw6BmYHA7jCcQ%3D%3D)) and the motors ([Igarashi](http://www.igusa.com/pages/motors/NN2953.html)). To borrow a line from "The Big Lebowski," he's _very thorough._

It's a good way to burn 12 minutes of time, and thankfully, it's not a one-off video. A forthcoming video will look at the common points of failure in the door handle assembly. That could be a boon for mechanically inclined owners, as some of these handles are now out of warranty.

If this is up your alley, I'd suggest [following him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hoonable), where he regularly discusses individual vehicle components, their costs and whether or not they're shared with other vehicles. It's a parts-geek paradise over there.
