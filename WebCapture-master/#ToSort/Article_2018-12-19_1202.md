There are multiple smart accessories such as smart glasses, smart watches, etc. available in the market. But all of them are built for us. There is a significant lack of technology to aid the physically challenged.

I wanted to build something that is useful for the visually challenged people. So I designed a low-cost smart glass that can be used to help the visually impaired.

This project uses a few ultrasonic distance sensors, an Arduino Pro Mini, an MP3 player module, and some vibration motors. The circuit board used in this project in the form of a spectacle, which can be worn by a visually impaired person. An Arduino mounted on the spectacle will detect the obstacle with the help of the sensors and notify the user distance and direction of the obstacle through headphones and vibration motors.

## Step 1: Gather the Components

![Picture of Gather the Components](https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/CPB5/JPLJ7G5K/F11CPB5JPLJ7G5K.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&width=933)

**Software:**

  * Arduino IDE

**Hardware Components:**

  * HC-SR04 - Ultrasonic Sensor X 3
  * DFRobot DF Player mini X 1
  * Arduino Pro Mini X 1
  * 3.5mm Audio jack X 1
  * Vibration motors X 3

  * USB to Serial Converter like [FTDI](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-1pcs-FT232RL-FTDI-USB-3-3V-5-5V-to-TTL-Serial-Adapter-Module/32481520135.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.1.12cd548arsA6xl&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4_10065_10068_319_10059_10884_317_10887_10696_100031_321_322_10084_453_10083_454_10103_10618_10307_538_537_536,searchweb201603_51,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=d023484c-ea1e-44fe-822d-94e3e2a770fb-0&algo_pvid=d023484c-ea1e-44fe-822d-94e3e2a770fb)

  * Slide Switch X 1

  * SD Card (Any size)

  * Custom PCB From [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Talking_Smart_Glass_For_Blind.html) (Optional)

## Step 2: Coding Time - Program the Arduino Pro Mini

![Picture of Coding Time - Program the Arduino Pro Mini](https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/JS1A/JPLIYMNQ/FASJS1AJPLIYMNQ.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3:2)

  * Go to <https://github.com/B45i/Talking-Smart-Glass-For-Blind> and click on **clone or download**, and download and extract the files.
  * Connect the Pro Mini to the computer using FTDI cable.
  * Select proper COM port.
  * Select 'Arduino Pro or Pro Mini.'
  * Click upload

_Make sure to flash Arduino before soldering it to PCB. Once all the components are soldered, it will be bit harder to connect the programming header._

Change the **_minLeftDistance, minCenterDistance, minRightDistance_** to adjust the minimum triggering distance.

## Step 3: Fixing Errors !!!

![Picture of Fixing Errors !!!](https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/IOXZ/JPLIYPIV/F7KIOXZJPLIYPIV.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3:2)

You will probably see some errors like
    
    
    fatal error: NewPing.h: No such file or directory<br>#include<NewPing.h>^ 
    compilation terminated. exit status 1 Error compiling for board Arduino Pro or Pro Mini.

or some thing like:
    
    
    fatal error: DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h: No such file or directory<br>#include<DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h>^ 
    compilation terminated. exit status 1 Error compiling for board Arduino Pro or Pro Mini.

This is because the libraries like **NewPing **and **DFRobotDFPlayerMini** is not installed on your IDE.

**To fix this, Go to **

> Sketch > Include Libraries > Manage Libraries

Enter the missing library name on the search bar and click install, this will install the missing library.

**Do this for all the missing libraries.**

The code will compile and upload now.

## Step 4: Prepare the SD Card

![Picture of Prepare the SD Card](https://cdn.instructables.com/FJB/A8LG/JPLIYR35/FJBA8LGJPLIYR35.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp)

Copy **content **of the **Audio files** folder to the root of the SD card.

> Note: Copy folders (01, 02, 03) itself, not its content, not the **Audio files** folder.

SD card should look like in the image after copying.

## Step 5: Soldering Time..

![Picture of Soldering Time..](https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/QCV6/JPLIYUHZ/FZYQCV6JPLIYUHZ.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp)

Solder the components like Arduino, DF Player, Audio Jack, Slide Switches to the PCB first.

> Don't directly solder the HC-SR04 module, We need to do some modifications

  1. Straighten the male header using a plier or de-solder the 90Â° headers and solder normal headers. 
  2. Add electrical tape to the back of HC-SR04 to avoid short circuit. 
  3. Insert HC-SR04 to designated solder pads. hold the left and right HC-SR04 at an angle so that it points to the left and direction and apply solder.

Solder rest of the components such as power supply cable, slide switches, vibration motors etc.

Vibration motors should be soldered to the back of the PCB so that person wearing the glass can feel the vibrations.

If you don't have access to the PCB, you can still make the project by connecting the components as shown in the circuit diagram.

You can insert the SD Card into the DFPlayer now.

After connecting power, motors should vibrate and audio will come from headphones when there is an obstacle.

## Step 6: Done.

![Picture of Done.](https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Y/ZP3K/JPLIZ9LB/F6YZP3KJPLIZ9LB.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&width=400)

You are now done.
