With a computer, **thrashing** or **disk thrashing** describes when a [hard drive](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/harddriv.htm) is being overworked by moving information between the [system](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/system.htm) [memory](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm) and [virtual memory](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/virtmemo.htm) excessively. Thrashing occurs when the system does not have enough memory, the system swap file is not properly configured, too much is running at the same time, or has low system [resources](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/resource.htm).

When thrashing occurs you will notice the computer hard drive always working and a decrease in system performance. Thrashing is bad on the hard drive because of the amount of work the hard drive has to do and if left unfixed can cause an early hard drive [failure](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/failure.htm).

## How to eliminate thrashing

To resolve hard drive thrashing you can do any of the suggestions below.

  1. Increase the amount of [RAM](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/ram.htm) in the computer.
  2. Decrease the number of programs being run on the computer.
  3. Adjust the size of the [swap file](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/swapfile.htm).
