With an app-specific password, you can use iCloud Mail through IMAP even with 2-step authentication enabled.

### Security and Convenience for Your iCloud Mail Account

2-step authentication is the way to go to lock your [iCloud Mail](https://www.lifewire.com/icloud-mail-review-1172292) account for good--and that does include the good email programs on your computers and devices that you set up to access iCloud Mail through [IMAP](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-imap-do-1166415). The password you used in the past will be rejected and the email client without new mail.

That does not mean you have to do without IMAP access and your favorite email program, though: you can have iCloud Mail create a safe and random password for each program or service you use to access the account. The password will ideally only be stored in the program you created it for and [can be easily revoked](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-secure-icloud-mail-1172270) at any time when you stop using that program or service, or when you fear the password may have been stolen.
