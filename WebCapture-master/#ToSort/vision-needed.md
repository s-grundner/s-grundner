Well, I did it! I finally completed term 1 of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The past three months has been a bumpy ride to say the least and I have successfully steered through the obstacles faced during this time, both virtually and figuratively!

During this period, I have spent many all-nighters chugging down on redbull and coffee in an attempt to consume enough caffeine to stick it out and get through the various hurdles the course throws at you. I have on multiple ocassions spent days working on an idea only to get so frustrated with the results and progress to go ahead and scrap it entirely. Only to later realize that I had been right all along but made a tiny error in executing it!

In hindsight(*spoiler alert), it was worth all the trouble!

Here are my thoughts about the course…

_*_**_Disclaimer_**_: I hope this article helps anyone debating whether or not to take up such a course or not! I had planned on providing an in depth review after completing every project but my time management skills failed me once again. Thus, I won't be reviewing the projects in depth(which has already been covered extensively by my peers) but instead describe my experience till now…_

### Why did I take up the course?

After graduating last year, I had absolutely no idea on what I wanted to do next. I spent my final semester of my undergrad days watching on as everyone around me were sitting for placements or already applying for a specific masters program. I knew I wanted to study further, but I had no clue about which field to major in, nor did I want to take up a stuck up job at an IT firm who prey on engineering graduates.

So, I decided to take a break to figure out what I wanted to pursue next. I always had a fondness towards mathematics and that's what got me through engineering. I also developed an inkling towards Robotics during my undergrad days by working on many mini projects using protyping platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the Lego Mindstorms.

I thus directed my focus to the fields of **Robotics** and **AI**. Prior to joining the [SDCND](https://in.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013/), I completed "The Control of Mobile Robots" course on Coursera by Dr. Magnus Egerstedt and "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics" on Udacity led by Sebastian Thrun himself. Both are amazing courses and I would suggest anyone who want to get into the field of Robotics to take them.

My undergrad and the course on mobile robotics gave an insight to the traditional control systems approach to Robotics but I still needed to gain knowledge in AI to learn its cognitive application.

I thus enrolled for SDCND not with an intention to get into the ADAS([Advanced driver assistance systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver_assistance_systems)) industry per se but to take part instead in an application specific course that deals primarily in the field of AI and Robotics.

#### My past experiences with online learning

I had enrolled in online courses in the past but never really completed any of it. The excitement and interest was always palpable at first, but soon the course became like a monotonous routine and thus lost its charm. Once that happened it was a matter of time before the course went on the backburner, overshadowed by your daily activities.

This is **the** **biggest drawback** to online learning. The lack of constant interaction between peers and teachers on a daily basis which a university education provides still acts as one of the biggest stimulant to motivate the student to complete the tasks in hand. The fear factor which is produced by interaction with your peers is something that cannot be replicated in an online course.

I found Udacity to come closest in replicating these characteristics without the downsides. It is definitely not perfect just yet but it's definitely the next best bet. I'll do my best to illustrate my view on the same below…

### The Udacity way of learning

> _[www.udacity.com/drive](http://www.udacity.com/drive)_

**"Jobs of tomorrow start here", **that's the mission statement for Udacity. Their aim is to democratize education by providing an opportunity to everyone to gain knowledge in the most popular and demanding fields.

Their work has been undeniable till now. In a short period of time(founded in 2012) they have become one the best MOOC's available today and I would like to provide an insight to what I believe separates them from the rest of the competition.

### Term -1 overview:

The SDCND in particular costs $800 per term(Rs. 53,000) and spans for three terms. The terms are divided up as follows:

Every term is scheduled for three months and can be completed within a shorter duration. Term-1 is spanned across 5 core projects with the sole focus to create a strong base and fundamentals in the field of computer vision, neural networks and deep learning.

Here are details about core projects for term 1 accompanied with a snippet from my attempt at the same:

  1. **Lane line detection** using traditional computer vision techniques(color gradient, canny edge detection and hough transform)

> _Pipeline Visual_

> _P1 Output Video_

**2.** Build a** traffic sign classifier** using Tensorflow based on a Convolutional Neural Network Model that can finally predict traffic signs based upon 43 classes set using German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark(GTSRB) dataset.

> _P2- Traffic Sign Classifier_

**3.** Drive a car autonomously(on a simulator of course!) using **behavioral cloning**(learning to drive the track after feeding in data of me driving the bot around the track) and deep learning.

> _The Simulator_

> _P3 Output Video_

**4\. Advanced lane finding** using advanced computer vision techniques like gradient and color thresholding, perspective transform and lane finding using histogram.

> _Pipeline Visualization_

> _P4 Output Video_

**5\. Vehicle detection **on road using HOG technique and a supervised classification algorithm of choice(I used Support Vector Machines)

> _Pipeline Visualization_

> _P5 Output Video_

You can check out the code for all these projects [here](https://github.com/harish3110).

The projects need tweaking and further modifications, a revisit to these projects without a deadline hanging over your head will hopefully make a world of difference.

### The Strengths

It's pretty obvious after reading thus far that I am a big fan of Udacity and their Nanodegree style of learning, especially their SDCND program. So, to wrap it up here are the key reasons as to why Udacity is better than most of their competition and why they stand out:

  * **Course Material: **Udacity has spent considerable amount of resources to develop high quality content for their course that is updated regularly based on the feedback from their students. To enhance it further, they partner with the [best in the business](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/jobs-with-udacity-hiring-partners-a831ef7efdc8) to develop course material that is necessary to land their dream job. The course material provided is more than enough in completing the projects assigned. Resources are then provided to improve upon it. This provides a freedom to mess around and dive deeper into the concepts just learned.
  * **Mentor Program: **Every student in the course is appointed with a mentor. The mentors role is to help and guide the student with any roadblocks they face along the course. The mentor is the direct point of contact for the student throughout by providing weekly updates regarding their progress and difficulties faced. Although, the mentors performance will undoubtedly vary from person to person but the act of sharing your goals and progress with someone else makes one feel more accountable and thus pushes them to complete them.
  * **The Projects: **The core projects in the course curriculum are truly amazing. They are pragmatic and help visualise the concepts learnt succinctly, which makes learning hard topics easier. The projects combined have been designed like a jigsaw puzzle, where every project is built to teach a particular aspect and all the concepts learnt in term-1 come together quite beautifully in the final project.
  * **The Community: **Apart from all this, the greatest asset for a student taking the course is the opportunity to interact with like minded people around the world. Udacity has developed a platform for people to come together and discuss about the most intellectual topics today in the world of technology. As the thought process varies from person to person, it is amazing to see anothers perception of a concept and their idea in implementing it. Also seeing [the work of your peers](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/udacity-students-build-tools-for-computer-vision-deep-learning-and-the-didi-challenge-db6eb14f27c7) acts as a catalyst that motivates you to produce similar results and also teaches you new concepts along the way.

**Also worth mentioning…**

#**Udacity Career Support: **Other than the course material, Udacity also helps students to improve their career prospects by providing lessons to build their profile. I must admit that I didn't pay much attention to these as my main intent of joining the course was to learn further and not look for a job in particular. On a glance it does look pretty great and I have it on good authority that it's very helpful. Anyway, for more info click [here](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com).

### The Shortcomings

Although I have given a glowing praise to the course thus far, it isn't without its flaws.

  * **Hiring for foreign students: **This is a major question mark among many students. Udacity has partnered with some of the best companies in world right now likes of Mercedez, Uber, Ford, BMW, Nvidia to name a [few](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/jobs-with-udacity-hiring-partners-a831ef7efdc8). It is but natural that anyone who wants a career in the self-driving car industry wouldn't mind working with them. But being from the subcontinent, I know a lot of people taking the course here who are especially perturbed by the lack of transparancy on how they would go ahead with such hirings due to various hassles involved like visa approval etc.
  * **Group projects: **This is something I believe Udacity should implement in their Nanodegree courses(atleast as optional projects). Pairing up students in a small group to work on a projects will help enrich the learning experience further. Group projects are analogous to real life projects which are rarely done individually. More importantly it'll help foster vital skills like teamwork, delegation, communication etc. and also help in pooling their knowledge and thus help improve.
  * **PLEASE stop with the spoon-feeding**: The autonomous car industry has gained a major rise in popularity over the past couple of years. Thus courses like SDCND has a great demand because people want to shift to a career path that will be promising in the future. This is great for the field in general but it has taken a negative impact on the course. The pre-cohort students were provided with the bare minimum necessary which included the basic concepts and additional reading material to get through with the projects. But with time in order to help students taking the coures clear the projects, which are not straightforward to say the least, Udacity are providing more and more supplemental material to help students clear the roadblocks faced with them. This impedes the learning process drastically. Learning to learn is crucial in such fields which involves a lot of research as everything hasn't been figured out and requires a lot more innovation and work.

### Penny for your thought?

In today's world with its limited resources, globalization without innovation in technology is unsustainable. Artificial Intelligence is the way of the future. The day when a person can call in a uber(that is, if it can wither the current storm!) and a driverless car will arrive at your place to drive you to your destination isn't very far fetched and hopefully not so distant scenario.

Sure, there are a lot(an understatement to say the least) of things that need to be sorted out before any of this can become a reality. But I for one have developed enough passion for the field to continue to work at it and envision that future.

Here's an excerpt from Martin Ford's bestseller "Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future" about the current situation of AI:

> "In particular, the rise of companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon has propelled a great deal of progress. Never before have such deep-pocketed corporations viewed artificial intelligence as absolutely central to their business models -- and never before has AI research been positioned so close to the nexus of competition between such powerful entities. A similar competitive dynamic is unfolding among nations. AI is becoming indispensable to militaries, intelligence agencies, and the surveillance apparatus in authoritarian states.* Indeed, an all-out AI arms race might well be looming in the near future."   
― **Martin Ford**

All the leading tech giants of the silicon valley have invested deeply in AI with a hope to reach a breakthrough and thus exert dominance and create a monopoly.

Taking a look at autonomous cars in particular, the concepts of deep learning such as Neural Networks and ConvNets have been established for a while now with no major progress in the field. The advancement in technology over the years in particular the introduction of GPU's, has enabled the hardware to finally catch up and thus process such huge amounts of data.

As a result the so called leaders in SDC all possess identical hardware(in some cases not so much a co-incidence as per recent [allegations](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/googles-waymo-just-dropped-explosive-lawsuit-uber-stealing-self-driving-tech/)) and only stand out completely due to their software implementation.

Due to this drastic emergence and hype in the field, the autonomous car industry which works hand in hand with AI research appears to be on the verge of a major breakthrough!

_Hopefully exciting times ahead for anyone in the field of self-driving cars, and can finally change the perception of hollywood regarding the field…_

### Why take up such a course?

> "The evaporation of thousands of skilled information technology jobs is likely a precursor for a much more wide-ranging impact on knowledge-based employment."   
― **Martin Ford**, **Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future**

Just to make it clear, this is not an easy course and not for everyone. It requires a major commitment to learning along with a flexible time schedule. Udacity says that around 10 hrs/week is sufficient to complete the course but that's no where close to amount I spent working on it. Most of the concepts although explained well are non-intuitive by nature and thus required a little more research.

That being said with the increased acceptance of AI and machine learning more and more jobs are underscrutiny and risk being automated. The "new economy" as coined by Cal Newport in his bestseller "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" is on the horizon. Here's an excerpt form his book about the same…

> "There are Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy :

> 1\. The ability to quickly master hard things.

> 2\. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed."   
― Cal Newport

Courses like the SDCND provide a perfect platform for students all around the world to work on these fields with a focus on practical and application based learning on the most demanding fields in the future.

Although, it may not have the credibility of a standard degree just yet, but working on such courses prove that the individual has the tenacity to work on something hard and more importantly is willing to learn. Lifelong learning is the key to succeed in this day and age.

Being from a non-computer science background, this course has been the biggest intellectual challenges I have faced yet. In return, it has instilled a very strong affinity to the field of Artficial Intelligence and I hope to work in the same. Our generation faces an uphill challenge to create and imagine new technologies to ensure a more peaceful and prosperous future.
