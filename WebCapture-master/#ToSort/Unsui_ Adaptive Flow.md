I'm watching late night TV. A panel of unemployed "youths" is talking about how hard things are: How many CVs they've sent out, how many times they've gone to the job centre, how bad it is sitting at home all day watching TV. They've been trying hard, doing everything they know how to do. But as the months go by, they are frustrated and scared that life is passing them by, that they will become yet another statistic -- a new member of the "lost generation."

I do feel badly for them, because they really are trying everything they know. So I'm a bit alarmed when my inner [Norman Tebbit](http://bbc.in/15ooF3C) rears its ugly head and starts screaming at the TV: "don't just sit at home waiting for a job, start a business! Even the proverbial lemonade stand is going to help you more than what you are doing!" But neither the politician nor the journalist on the show mention this; they just nod their heads gravely.

I'm talking to a fifty-something teacher who is tired of her job. Thanks to a culture of micromanagement set up by successive governments, she spends so much time documenting what she's doing, that there's little energy left for actually teaching. She's not sure what she should do next or how to do it. She thinks she "doesn't have the right qualifications" for other things or the time to pursue them. I unhelpfully suggest that she could explore some micro-entrepreneurial alternatives. After all, there are very few professions that have as many transferable skills as teaching. But she doesn't feel confident enough to do something that isn't a job.

#### Stagnation and Flow

As we go through life, we pour ourselves into different containers: a school, a job, a circle of friends. They give us shape and hold us together by providing income and social identity. The downside of containers is that we risk becoming too dependent on them. If they are too solid, we can stagnate within them. If they leak, crack or disappear altogether, we risk being spilt on the ground ourselves. We need to cultivate the ability to continuously flow from one container to another as circumstances change. In stable times, we can linger, and flow slowly. But in turbulent times we need to flow quickly.

For 200 years, most of us have depended on a container called the job. But the job as a model is disappearing for a variety of reasons and many among us are unprepared. Our belief in orderly change has always been a complacent illusion. As Daniel Kahneman puts it:

> Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance…(we)see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable and coherent than it really is…These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence.

Our biggest obstacle is our own fear of uncertainty and disruption, and our ostrich-like response. We have fooled ourselves to expect that we can choose an occupation for life.

We have forgotten who we are. We got here by using our ingenuity to continuously adapt to changing circumstances. We have travelled further than any other species. Yes, we've broken a few things along the way, and we will continue to do so. But so far we've demonstrated an amazing ability to self-correct and muddle through. We haven't done so by following the plans of a few experts. We've done it by individually trying different approaches, choosing the ones that worked best, and passing them on. Sometimes these have been our own ideas, but mostly they've been mashups or copies of others' ideas. We've been pivoting for centuries.

#### It's not just about startups

If you are reading this, you're probably already drinking the startup Koolaid, so you may share my inability to really get under the skin of this passivity. But we are lucky. Some of us because we've been through the ups and downs of startups and freelancing for long enough to feel reasonably comfortable with the ebbs and flows. Others because you are still young and inexperienced enough to think you are indestructible. As my first startup boss told me "The reason you think risk is so cool is that you haven't had a big loss yet."

But as a culture we have now distanced ourselves so much from this habit of continuous evolution that we now give it fancy names such as leadership, entrepreneurship, design, creativity or innovation. Unfortunately, these names just serve to exclude those who most need to cultivate the habit of flowing. Like being a rock star or an Olympic athlete, people assume these are things that only a select few are supposed to be able to do. So they give up playing the guitar or training and they wait for someone to rescue them.

We need to regain our ability to evolve and even thrive in the midst of uncertainty. This is more than _just_ about startups, business or innovation. A lot of the tools and practices are the same. But the objective is different. It's not a finite project , and it doesn't have an exit. Its purpose is allowing you to craft a way of life that will sustain you not only economically, but personally. It's about regaining the ability to creatively disrupt ourselves on an ongoing basis. This is actually good news. Flow theory has demonstrated that we thrive when we are able to surf in the boundary between the boredom of order and the anxiety of chaos.

We need a new term which avoids the narrow exclusivity of "startup." I came a cross a good one: Zen novices are called "Unsui," which literally translates into "cloud and water" but also implies the ability to float and flow, at once both with and without form. I like this idea because it captures the concept of punctuated disequilibrium and adaptation as we flow from one container to another, just as water moves from ice to liquid to gas and back again.

#### It's not just about individuals

Unsui is not just about individuals. Collectively, we are part of a complex, self-organizing and adaptive social system. That means a lot of things, but it basically implies that everything we build -- economies, cities, cultures -- emerges as a result of individuals following "simple rules" and interacting with each other. Yes, the whole _is _bigger than the sum of its parts. But the stronger the parts, and the more adaptable their simple rules, the better the results.

That's what the habit of Unsui is about, helping everyone cultivate a set of economic and cultural habits that increase our ability to thrive individually and together.

#### How do we do this?

So how do we this? I don't really know, that's what this collection is going to be about, but here's some initial ideas for later posts to get the conversation rolling:

  1. **Change our attitude**. Accept that change itself is a certainty, but its nature in terms of direction or speed is fundamentally uncertain. Recognise that we fear change and uncertainty because we are unprepared for it.
  2. **Come Home**. Stuart Kauffman has defined adaptive systems as those that "balance divergence and convergence, so that they are poised between chaos and order." This boundary between chaos and order is our natural habitat. Not just at the system level, but it's also where we thrive individually. We appear to be the only species capable of deliberate evolution. It's time all of us got good at surfing within it. We need to develop a greater understanding of complexity and integrate it into our actions.
  3. **Learn by practising**. Evolution is fundamentally just about learning. We are not talking about passive classroom learning where someone teaches us facts. If the future is unpredictable; we can't predict what knowledge we will require. But we can learn to engage with uncertainty as it emerges by practising and developing our 'co-evolution muscles' and [using all our tools](http://bit.ly/10FMSm3). We can do this by emulating how musicians learn to improvise, craftsmen to create, or the surfer to ride the wave. They build and play to learn, learn to build and play. There is no real difference between practice and performance.
  4. **Come up with new models of organisation.** We need new "places" besides jobs where we can get together with others to build, play and learn. Some examples might be the ways film makers organise themselves around serial projects while freelancing in between, or musicians oscillate between jams, solo gigs, and bands. This is different from just freelancing. It adds a layer of continuity and cohesion that freelancing doesn't offer.

_Unsui 0.1 was a dissertation I wrote for a Master's degree. It has served its purpose well, but it was bogged down by footnotes and all the crossing of t's and dotting of i's that academic writing requires. I'm more interested in translating interesting ideas into useful practice and language anyone can understand. Unsui 0.2 was a short talk I gave at a company's away day. The next step is to flesh out some of these ideas in other posts._
