A few days ago I wrote a [post on the lack of cybersecurity skills in corporate boards](https://dzone.com/articles/how-boards-can-prioritize-cybersecurity-in-corpora), and how to fix that. This became one of the most popular posts on the blog. That's why I created this short summary video - that you can easily share with your top management and board members.

## The Take-Aways Are:

  * Build an information security management system with the most important policies, guidelines, procedures, change management, and monitoring processes in place.
  * Select reporting metrics that make sense in terms of the company strategy. Relate impact to financial, customer, organization and learning, and internal process perspectives.
  * Use compliance to drive board focus: regulatory compliance is already central in governance work.
  * Focus on people when communicating - build a positive security culture by combining bottom-up and top-down approaches.
