Speed and user experience. This is the mantra of the AMP Project as we seek to make the web fast and compelling. Speed is also the byword in the project's growth and progress. In the six weeks since the October 7 announcement, there has been a whirlwind of activity from publishers, technology providers and developers.

Thousands of publishers have expressed interest in AMP since the preview launched with the likes of the BBC, Sankei, New York Times, News Corp, Washington Post and [more](https://www.ampproject.org/). Since then, many others have committed their support to the project, including R7.com and NZN Group in Brazil; CBS Interactive, AOL, Thrillist, Slate, International Business Times/Newsweek, Al Jazeera America and The Next Web in the US; El Universal and Milenio in Mexico; The Globe and Mail and Postmedia in Canada, as well as many more across the globe. The Local Media Consortium (LMC), a partnership of 70+ media companies collectively representing 1,600 local newspapers and television stations, has also voiced their support.

As an open-source initiative, the AMP Project is open to ad partners across the industry who adopt the spec, and we're seeing incredible momentum from the ecosystem. Today we're announcing that Outbrain, AOL, OpenX,, DoubleClick, and AdSense are working within the framework to improve the advertising experience for users, publishers and advertisers on the mobile web. More to come as we continue to ramp this aspect of the effort.

Ensuring that traffic to AMP articles is counted just like current web articles is also a major focus of the project. comScore, Adobe Analytics, Parse.ly and Chartbeat have all stated that they intend to provide analytics for AMP pages within their tools. They have since been joined by many others: Nielsen, ClickTale and Google Analytics. This development is significant for the AMP Project because publishers developing for AMP will not skip a beat in terms of analytics and measurement -- analytics for AMP are real time and will work within your existing provider.

And as for the developer community forming around AMP, more than 4500 developers are following the AMP Project's ongoing engineering discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml). Since the announcement, over 250 pull requests -- contributions of new code, samples, and documentation -- have been made; and discussions around major new features such as [analytics](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/871) and [templates](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/657) have taken place.

Google will begin sending traffic to your AMP pages in Google Search early next year, and we plan to share more concrete specifics on timing very soon. In the meantime, the AMP Project invites everyone to take part in the conversation on GitHub, and encourages you to begin experimenting with building AMP pages as soon as possible.
