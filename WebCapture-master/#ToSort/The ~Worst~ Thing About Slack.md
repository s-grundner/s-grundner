## 2\. Starting, idk, a few weeks ago, Slack made a disastrous decision.

A game-changer, honestly. This could be curtains for the hot startup productivity/chat tool, which has skyrocketed in popularity over the last year, and seemingly is doing just great. But with this massive and colossal misjudgement, the entire company stands at the precipice of a mass revolt.

## 3\. They changed the function of ~tildes~ (which are ~clearly~ intended for ironic emphasis) so that now when you place them on either side of a word it creates a strikethrough.

## 4\. Slack has made some confusing comments about it in the past…

> @Andy__Lincoln Maybe. We've always had a thing for tildes, though.

> -- Slack (@SlackHQ) 

> A "thing" for them? Like you want to DESTROY them, hmmmm?

## 5\. Apparently, Slack thinks strikethrough is "funnier" than tildes. Which, um, _NO_.

> With strikethrough now usable in Slack, everyone is instantly 23% m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶d̶u̶c̶t̶i̶v̶e̶ funnier. Reload, then ~do this~! #changelog
> 
> -- Slack (@SlackHQ) 

> Strikethrough humor is soooooo 2010.

## 6\. Everyone knows that on the internet, [enclosing words in tildes has ~meaning~](http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-hidden-language-of-the-tilde).

Especially on Twitter, when a short character limit means you need to be inventive to indicate tone. The tildes often signal irony, ambivalence, or just plain emphasis. The best way I can describe tilde use is that it works when you need to say something that's just ~squiggly~.

## 7\. If Slack is doing this to appease coders, I REJECT THAT.

Ok, so this is almost certainly because of Markdown (and more specifically, [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)) a tool that turns text into HTML. In Markdown, putting tildes around a word makes it appear as strikethrough text. Using Markdown makes some sense, I ~guess~, since many of Slack's clients use it for coding and other technical purposes.

But what about the rest of us? Those of us who don't know shit about Markdown or coding or [who John Gruber is](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or ~whatever~ man? What about the people who NEED our tildes back so we can actually communicate with each other in the language that is ~native~ to online discussion???? WHAT ABOUT US???????

## 9\. THE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING IT:

> Hey @SlackHQ, can you make -word- be a strikethrough instead of ~word~ pleeeeease? I need tildes to stay tildes!

## 13\. Everyone agrees, it's universally reviled.

> Is Slack displaying ~tildes~ as strikethough:
> 
> -- Katie Notopoulos (@katienotopoulos) 

> As of posting time, 88% of respondents believe tildes causing a strikethrough is "literally Hitler".

  1. Should Slack revert to having tildes be tildes? 
    1. Yes, and I'll cry if they don't. 
    2. No, I prefer tildes being strikethrough. 
    3. WTF is Slack?
