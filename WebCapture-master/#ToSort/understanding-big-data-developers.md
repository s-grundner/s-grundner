Big Data developers are extremely important - they help companies make smarter business decisions, update processes, drive profits, and create and keep happy customers.

Their data scientist-y thinking combined with programming and coding skills makes big data developers unique, and necessary if organizations want to fully understand the data they're capturing.

In preparation of our upcoming Research Guide, _Guide to Big Data: Data Science & Advanced Analytics_, we surveyed the DZone audience to understand the habits, preferences, and needs of Big Data developers and software professionals.

Our initial survey research shows:

  * **R (60.6%)** and **Python (62.8%)** are the most common languages/libraries/frameworks used for data science and machine learning;
  * The biggest challenge in data science is unsanitized data
  * **Agile is the most common project management methodology** used in data science projects
  * **78.4% say Java **is the programming language ecosystem their company uses
  * 30.4% says their **Immediate team size is between 6-10 people**
  * Big Data professionals are experienced, with **36.1% having 15+ years of professional experience**

Another interesting tidbit: 82.6% say reading articles on various tech sites is their preferred method of learning and keeping up-to-date on the industry.

The Guide, released on April 24th, will also cover survey research on tools and frameworks Big Data developers recommend and use, pain points associated with big data, common data set sizes, and more.

## **The Future of Big Data, According to Execs**

Our own Research Analyst, Tom Smith, spoke with 22 executives from 20 companies to understand the challenges, opportunities, and changes in the big data industry.

Here are some takeaways from his interviews:

  * **Big data is evolving**. How can you take advantage of the data you have? Are their opportunities for your company to make a difference?
  * **There is not enough emphasis on security and reliability. **Not enough emphasis on where data is coming from and how to keep it safe and clean. 
  * **Prepare for adoption of the cloud when constructing the architecture where data will live.**
  * **Help people understand customers better by analyzing buyer behavior and web metrics.**
  * **Having the right people is huge.** We have a qualified candidate crisis. Data scientists must keep their skills at cutting edge and know what tools are evolving to solve their problems.
