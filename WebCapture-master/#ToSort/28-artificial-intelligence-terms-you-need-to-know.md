As artificial intelligence becomes less of an ambiguous marketing buzzword and more of a precise ideology, it's increasingly becoming a challenge to understand all of the AI terms out there. So to kick off the brand new [AI Zone](https://dzone.com/artificial-intelligence-tutorials-tools-news), the Editorial Team here at DZone got together to define some of the biggest terms in the world of artificial intelligence for you.

## A

**Algorithms**: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI, neural network, or other machines to help it learn on its own; classification, clustering, recommendation, and regression are four of the most popular types.

**Artificial intelligence**: A machine's ability to make decisions and perform tasks that simulate human intelligence and behavior.

**Artificial neural network (ANN)**: A learning model created to act like a human brain that solves tasks that are too difficult for traditional computer systems to solve.

**Autonomic computing**: A system's capacity for adaptive self-management of its own resources for high-level computing functions without user input.

## C

**Chatbots**: A chat robot (chatbot for short) that is designed to simulate a conversation with human users by communicating through text chats, voice commands, or both. They are a commonly used interface for computer programs that include AI capabilities.

**Classification**: Classification algorithms let machines assign a category to a data point based on training data.

**Cluster analysis**: A type of unsupervised learning used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data; clusters are modeled with a measure of similarity defined by metrics such as Euclidean or probabilistic distance.

**Clustering**: Clustering algorithms let machines group data points or items into groups with similar characteristics.

**Cognitive computing**: A computerized model that mimics the way the human brain thinks. It involves self-learning through the use of data mining, natural language processing, and pattern recognition.

**Convolutional neural network (CNN)**: A type of neural networks that identifies and makes sense of images.

## D

**Data mining**: The examination of data sets to discover and mine patterns from that data that can be of further use.

**Data science**: An interdisciplinary field that combines scientific methods, systems, and processes from statistics, information science, and computer science to provide insight into phenomenon via either structured or unstructured data.

**Decision tree**: A tree and branch-based model used to map decisions and their possible consequences, similar to a flow chart.

**Deep learning**: The ability for machines to autonomously mimic human thought patterns through artificial neural networks composed of cascading layers of information.

## F

**Fluent**: A type of condition that can change over time.

## G

**Game AI**: A form of AI specific to gaming that uses an algorithm to replace randomness. It is a computational behavior used in non-player characters to generate human-like intelligence and reaction-based actions taken by the player.

**Genetic algorithm**: An evolutionary algorithm based on principles of genetics and natural selection that is used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems that would otherwise take decades to solve.

## H

**Heuristic search techniques**: Support that narrows down the search for optimal solutions for a problem by eliminating options that are incorrect.

## K

**Knowledge engineering**: Focuses on building knowledge-based systems, including all of the scientific, technical, and social aspects of it.

## L

**Logic programming**: A type of programming paradigm in which computation is carried out based on the knowledge repository of facts and rules; LISP and Prolog are two logic programming languages used for AI programming.

## M

**Machine intelligence**: An umbrella term that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, and classical learning algorithms.

**Machine learning**: A facet of AI that focuses on algorithms, allowing machines to learn without being programmed and change when exposed to new data.

**Machine perception**: The ability for a system to receive and interpret data from the outside world similarly to how humans use our senses. This is typically done with attached hardware, though software is also usable.

## N

**Natural language processing**: The ability for a program to recognize human communication as it is meant to be understood.

## R

**Recurrent neural network (RNN)**: A type of neural network that makes sense of sequential information and recognizes patterns, and creates outputs based on those calculations.

## S

**Supervised learning**: A type of machine learning in which output datasets train the machine to generate the desired algorithms, like a teacher supervising a student; more common than unsupervised learning.

**Swarm behavior**: From the perspective of the mathematical modeler, it is an emergent behavior arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

## U

**Unsupervised learning**: A type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis.
