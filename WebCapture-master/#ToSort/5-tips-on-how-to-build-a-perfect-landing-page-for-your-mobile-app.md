We are living in a world where our time is more valuable than ever. With broad access to the Internet and thousands of websites fighting for our attention, we need to carefully pick the ones that are truly worth our time. And we are merciless while doing it. 2.6 seconds is the average amount of time that we are spending on a site before deciding whether we're staying or leaving forever. That's right, app owners, I am talking to you - you have only 2.6 seconds to convince us that we should spend some of our precious time on YOUR website - not your competitor's one. So the blood-thirsty race for users' attention begins. But is creating a perfect landing page for your app truly worth that huge amount of work and money? Definitely, yes!

Check out some of our tips, implement them on your website, and just sit tight. Before you notice, your app will get some extra hundreds and thousands of downloads! And I'm not joking - the stakes are really that high.

## #1 - Do Your Research!

The first step that every app owner should do before making his product landing page is thoroughly checking what the other successful companies' websites look like. The knowledge gathered through this process is truly priceless. It will spare you A LOT of time that you would probably waste if you decided on the trial and error method while building your landing page. Don't be afraid of benchmarking - if someone has done something right, there is nothing wrong with getting inspired by his solutions, especially if you are certain that they would work with your product as well.

The same goes for the other companies' mistakes. If you are brave enough, you can even mock your competitor's website, just as [Zarget](https://zarget.com/) did with a [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/) landing page:

[Zarget](https://zarget.com/) decided on a very creative way of showing that their products are far better, more innovative, and up-to-date than their competitor's. How? They've presented the [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/) logo as a "dead" product. And they've put it on their landing page! Thanks to [Zarget](https://zarget.com/)'s courageous move, a user entering their website has a clear image of the differences between those two very, at first sight, similar products. I don't know about you, but I would definitely switch to [Zarget](https://zarget.com/) after seeing something so awesome, good job!

## #2 - Put Your App in the Center of the User's Attention

The main goal of every mobile app landing page is making your users eager to download your app. That's obvious. So make sure that, in the jungle of other content visible on your page, your mobile app is still the most distinguishable one. If your users need to scroll for hours before getting a link to your app download - you're doomed. They will get bored after few seconds and leave your website without any hesitation. Here you have some examples:

The difference between those two app landing pages is visible from the first sight. The [Jaba Social](http://jaba.social/) landing page gives you clear access to download the app to your mobile phone. You definitely can't miss those big App Store and Google Play store buttons! Hyve, on the other hand, doesn't truly look like an app landing page, to be honest. More like a shop offering some furniture. The user will get that impression because the "download app" button is really small and easy to miss, not to mention the huge block of grey text overlaid on an also greyish photo. Yuck.

## #3 - Adjust Your Communication to Your Users

Now, as you have your landing page main goal written in stone, it's time to choose what kind of people will be the best medium to achieve that goal. Every web user is different: designers will pay attention to your landing page's beautifully created icons, clients will like to have clear access to the "offer" and "prices" sections, and investors will be the ones that will find your "successes," "media press," or "awards" sections to be the most important. While building a landing page, always have a specific person in mind who best resonates with your "perfect customer" image. Give him a name, a job, a country that he comes from - in a marketing, we call that "building a person." Find an example of a well-built persona profile below:

When you're picturing a certain person who would be a perfect target audience for your app, ideas about what you should put on your landing page often pop into your head by themselves. But wait - what if I have more than one person in mind when I'm thinking about the perfect user of my app? Of course you have, it's impossible to have just one, chill out. That's why sometimes, one landing page is not enough. If your target audiences vary between each other greatly, you should build a few websites for your app and make sure that the right people will encounter each one of them. How? Adjust your landing page to the source that brought your clients to you. Take the example of Melissa: having her in mind, you should promote your app landing page adjusted to her needs in places she probably spends her free time. For example, Facebook groups for moms, maternity, housewives blogs or dating websites. Having someone else in mind, you will pick different places to promote your second landing page, and so on.

If you think that's enough when it comes to adjusting your landing page to your target audience needs, unfortunately, I need to tell you, that you're wrong. Not only do you need to have your perople in mind while creating your landing page, but also the "phase" that they're currently at. We're distinguishing the main four ones: Awareness, Interest, Decision, and Action. They all depend on the stage that your client is considering his buying decision, from just hearing about your brand to ordering your product. There is a long way in between, but with the right landing page, it can become much more efficient!

## #4 - Keep It Simple

Now we're getting to the meat of the matter - your app landing page design. Obviously, it's extremely important. We have divided that part into smaller pieces to make sure you will understand each of them perfectly. Let's start!

### Design and Typography

Trends in web design change very rapidly. Don't follow them blindly, packing yourself into a very colorful, gif-and-text-filled website that will look cool only to you. The smartest way to make sure that your landing page won't get old too fast is deciding on a simple, transparent, and very user-friendly design. Use white spaces, big fonts, and mild colors - all that combined will give you a landing page that won't be too overwhelming for your users. If you can, try to avoid using free stock photos as well. They've been so widely used by various web owners that users have become allergic to them. Use your own graphics, photos, and video materials - your website visitors will definitely appreciate it!

### Call to Action

You need to make sure that your users' sight will naturally wander to the place on the page where your "Call to Action" button is. When it comes to mobile apps landing pages, the usual CTA button has the "DOWNLOAD THE APP" text written inside. To make sure that it will be extremely easy to find for the users, you can use arrows or photos of people clearly pointing in its direction.

### The Fold

Laptops are one of the most common devices to surf on the Internet nowadays, and the resolution of the huge majority of them is 1366x768px. That's why all of the most important elements of our landing page (headline, main graphic, CTA) _must_ placed above the fold of the page. What is the fold? It's a place which is visible to the users without the need to scroll down the whole website. Another important thing here is that you have to make sure that your web design is truly responsive and will be displayed well not only on laptops, but also on mobile phones and tablets.

### Social Proofs

Another important factor that your website should definitely have is something called a "social proof." It's an element that will convince your users that your mobile app quality is truly superior. It will also make you much more trustworthy in his eyes. Examples? Sure! Testimonials of your app happy users visible on your page. Links to social media accounts where you have already gathered a dedicated community. A list of partners who have decided to endorse your project. Put them on your website in a place that they won't be missed and I guarantee you they will make a great impression on your landing page visitors.

### Focus

Luring your users to your website is just a half-way success. You need to make sure that they will stay on it long enough to decide to download your app! How to do it? Don't distract them with links to other pages. Even if you have a really awesome YouTube account, don't link to it at the very beginning of the page. The danger is, after watching your video, the user will start looking at the "proposed video" section and, while watching other videos, he will slowly forget about your website completely. So remember: really carefully think about any links to external sites that you have on your landing page. Sometimes, not putting them at all is the best decision possible.

## #5 - Write Copy That Will Speak for Itself

A well-designed, responsive landing page filled with nice graphics is still not enough to bring your app thousands of new downloads. You need to fill it with interesting yet very engaging copy! One of the most important rules of web writing is that "less is more." Don't overwhelm your user with pages of text that he will easily get lost in. Don't elaborate about how your company was founded, its mission, and where you see yourself in 10 years. Focus on one question that the answer to is the most important for your user: ** what will I exactly gain from downloading your app? What kind of problems does your app solve? **

Start with writing a killer headline. Two lines of text, tops. You think that's too little to convince your user to download your app? Then you're wrong! Make sure that in this short text you will explain what your app is really about and what it has to offer its users. A well-written headline can bring you more value than you think. Based on our example, changing the words that we have on our website headline improved our conversion rate by 300%. That's a lot!

If you have decided to put some of your happy app users' testimonials on your website, make sure that they're loaded with only useful information and specific advantages that your app brings. There is no place here for empty words and sentences that mean nothing, like "the app is great, I would recommend it to my friends." Why? What did you like about it? What kind of value did the app bring to you? There are just too many questions and not enough answers.

## Key Takeaways

Building the right landing page is not a piece of cake; you can never truly say that your app website is really "finished." Even when it is finally visible on the Internet, you still should test different variations of it. Changing the CTA position, simplifying the filling form, or writing different copy - experiment with those features until you will find the best ones that will truly resonate with your clients! Honestly, there is no universal recipe for a perfect landing page, but I assure you that if you will stick to the guidelines presented above, establishing your own will definitely appear to be much, much easier.
