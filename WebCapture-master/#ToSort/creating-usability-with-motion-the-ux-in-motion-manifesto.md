The following manifesto represents my answer to the question -- "As a UX or UI, designer, how do I know when and where to implement motion to support usability?"

Over the last 5 years, it has been my privilege to coach and mentor UX & UI designers in over 40 countries, and at hundreds of the top brands and design consultancies through my workshops and tutorials on UI Animation.

After over fifteen years studying motion in user interfaces, I have come to the conclusion that there are 12 specific opportunities to support usability in your UX projects using motion.

I call these opportunities 'The 12 Principles of UX in Motion,' and they can be stacked and combined synergistically in a myriad of innovative ways.

I've broken the manifesto into 5 parts:

  1. Addressing the topic of UI Animation -- it's not what you think
  2. Realtime vs non-realtime interactions
  3. Four ways that motion supports usability
  4. Principles, Techniques, Properties and Values
  5. The 12 Principles of UX in Motion

As a quick plug, if you want me to speak at your conference or lead an onsite workshop for your team on the exciting topic of motion and usability, go [here](https://uxinmotion.net/workshops-and-speaking/). If you want to attend a class in your city go [here](https://uxinmotion.net/workshops-and-speaking/#classes). Finally, if you want me to consult on your project, you can go [here](https://uxinmotion.net/consulting/). To get articles on 'usability and motion' sent directly to your inbox, click below.

### It's not about UI Animation

Because the topic of motion in user interfaces is mostly understood by designers to be 'UI Animation'--which it is not -- I feel like I need to create a bit of context before we jump into the 12 Principles.

'UI Animation' is typically thought of by designers as something that makes the user experience more delightful, but overall doesn't add much value. Thus, UI Animation is often treated like the red-headed stepchild of UX (apologies to red-headed stepchildren everywhere). If at all, it usually comes at the end, as a final lipstick pass.

Additionally, motion in the context of user interfaces has understandably been held to be under the domain of Disney's 12 Principles of Animation, something I argue against in my article '[UI Animation Principles -- Disney is Dead](https://medium.com/@ux_in_motion/ui-animation-principles-disney-is-dead-8bf6c66207f9).'

In my manifesto, I will be making the case that UI Animation is to the '12 UX in Motion Principles' as construction is to architecture.

By this I mean, that while a structure needs to be physically built to exist (requiring construction), the guiding hand which determines _what_ gets built comes from the domain of Principles.

Animation is all about tools. Principles are the practical application of ideas that guide the usage of tools and as such, Principles provide high leverage opportunities for designers.

What most designers think of as 'UI Animation' is in fact the execution of a higher modality of design: the temporal behavior of interface objects during realtime and non-realtime events.

At this juncture, it is important to distinguish between 'state' and 'act.' The _state_ of something in UX is fundamentally static, like a design comp. The _act _of something in UX is fundamentally temporal, and motion based. An object can be in the _state _of being masked or it can be in the _act_ of being masked. If it is the latter, we know that motion is involved and in a way that could support usability.

Additionally, all temporal aspects of interaction can be thought of as happening in realtime or non-realtime. Realtime means that the user is directly interacting with the objects in the user interface. Non-realtime means that the object behavior is post-interactive: it occurs _after _a user action, and is transitional.

This is an important distinction.

Realtime interactions can also be though of as 'direct manipulation,' in that the user is interacting with the interface objects directly and _immediately_. The behavior of the interface is happening _as the user is using it._

Non-realtime interactions happen only _after _input from the user and have the effect of briefly locking the user out of the user experience until the transition completes.

These distinctions will give us leverage as we continue our journey into the world of the 12 Principles of UX in Motion.

### Motion supports usability in four ways

These four pillars represent the four ways where the temporal behavior of user experiences supports usability.

Expectation fall into two areas -- how users perceive what an object _is_, and how it _behaves_. Another way of saying this is that as designers, we want to minimize the gap between what the user expects, and what they experience.

Continuity speaks both to the user flow and to the 'consistency' of the user experience. Continuity can be thought of in terms of 'intra-continuity' -- the continuity within a scene, and 'inter-continuity' -- the continuity within a series of scenes that make up the total user experience.

Narrative is the linear progression of events in the user experience that results in a temporal/spatial framework. This can be thought of as the series of discreet moments and events that connect together throughout the user experience.

Relationship refers to the spatial, temporal, and hierarchal representations between interface objects that guide user understanding and decision making.
