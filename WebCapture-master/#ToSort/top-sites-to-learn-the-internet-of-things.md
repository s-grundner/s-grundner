Below is a list of IoT blogs you can read and follow to better understand the Internet of Things. These blogs provide up-to-date information, news, and all the technical aspects you need to go deeper into the IoT. These sites are my preferred information sources that I use to know what is happening in the IoT world. All these IoT blogs and sites cover different aspects related to IoT from the technical point of view to use cases and white papers. The order in the list is random.

## IoT Agenda

[IoT Agenda](http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/) is a very interesting website that covers all aspects related to the IoT ecosystem. In more detail, this IoT blog covers aspects related to enterprise IoT, IoT platforms, IoT security, and IoT vertical markets. It is updated regularly and it offers a deep insight into the Internet of Things world.

## DZone's IoT Zone

[DZone IoT](https://dzone.com/iot-developer-tutorials-tools-news-reviews) is a place you can find news, tutorials, and tools related to IoT. It is a gold mine if you want to learn the IoT and know it deeply. In this IoT blog, there are articles covering all aspects of IoT with detailed descriptions and real-life projects that can help you to better understand how and why IoT is the next disruptive technology. Moreover, DZone produces [Refcardz](https://dzone.com/refcardz) and [guides](https://dzone.com/guides) that contain detailed insights about specific topics. I'm one of the MVB authors at DZone.

## Bosch ConnectedWorld

We all know [Bosch](http://blog.bosch-si.com/). In this blog, they cover all aspects related to IoT from strategy to implementation. They have several experienced authors that give you a different point of view about IoT. The contributors are partners, customers, and so on.

## Hackster.io

[Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/) is a huge community of developers and makers. The main aim of this site is teaching people to design and to develop Internet-connected devices. It has several sections covering projects developed using different [prototyping IoT boards](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/2016/08/iot-rapid-prototyping-board.html). Here, you can find IoT projects described in detail and new ideas for your next project.

## Libelium

Even if [Libelium](http://www.libelium.com/) is not a real blog, it offers a great list of resources and white papers covering several aspects of IoT. You can use this site to learn more about IoT and how to develop real-life projects.

## IBM IoT

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/) is one of the biggest companies in IT. Its IoT blog is always up to date and teaches you the most innovative technologies around the Internet of Things. It covers areas related to IoT and IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things).

## Microsoft IoT

[Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/) is another big player active in the IoT area. In their blog, you can find information about their products related to Internet of things and articles about several aspects related to IoT.

## Arduino

[Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/) is one of the most used prototyping boards. I have used them several times in my [IoT projects](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/iot-projects-tutorial-list). In their blog, you will find interesting projects that use Arduino boards, and it is very useful when you want to approach IoT from the technical point of view. Their huge list of projects opens your mind and you can realize how many things can be done using IoT.

## Raspberry Pi

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/) prototyping boards are also widely used in IoT projects. Their blog offers you a complete understanding of the power of Raspberry boards and the projects we can build using them. It is the best place to learn how to use Raspberry Pi products and how to develop IoT projects.

## ReadWrite IoT

[ReadWrite IoT](https://readwrite.com/tag/internet-of-things/) is focused on providing relevant news about IoT. You will not find the source code of IoT projects here, but it opens your mind with real-life IoT implementations, use cases, and news. It covers several technology areas so you can find other information, too.

## CB Insights

As stated on its site, "The [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/category/industry/iot-industry/) tech market intelligence platform analyzes millions of data points on venture capital, startups, patents, partnerships and news mentions to help you see tomorrow's opportunities, today." You can find information about IoT and related technologies.

## IoT Council

The [IoT Council](http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/) provides the latest news about IoT. It offers a large selection of white papers and is great for guiding strategic decisions.

## IEEE IoT

The [IEEE IoT](http://iot.ieee.org/) mission statement reads: "The mission of the IEEE IoT Initiative is to serve as the gathering place for the global technical community working on the Internet of Things; to provide the platform where professionals learn, share knowledge, and collaborate on this sweeping convergence of technologies, markets, applications, and the Internet, and together change the world."
