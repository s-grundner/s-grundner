The ruby world has a phrase, 'Matz is Nice So We Are Nice.' Matz is the nickname for the creator of the ruby language. He is nice. So the community should be too. Given the lack of transparency from Apple around the direction of our toolset we don't really have anyone to use as an example. This talk is about people in the community who are nice, who have done cool things, to say thanks and to steal some ideas from them.
