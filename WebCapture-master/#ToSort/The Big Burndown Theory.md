"_Seemed like a good idea in the early days of Scrum, but in practice has often been misused as a management report, inviting intervention. The ScrumMaster should discontinue use of this chart if it becomes an impediment to team self-organization_" This is what [Michael James]() says in his [Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/ScrumReferenceCard.pdf)

Though many Agile leaders have cautioned the world against this double-edged sword called Burndown, we see this as a common practice, especially in large organizations where management can't trust the teams.

Burn-down is a great tool if it's used by the team to track their progress on a daily basis. Though sometimes the overhead can be greater than the value.

When burn-down is reviewed by the management to judge, assess & evaluate the teams, and intervene, it becomes an impediment to team's self-organization. As Jeff Sutherland said in one of his Google talks, a "Roomba" (iRobot vacuum cleaner) will never learn how to clean the room if someone keeps moving and directing it.

How was your experience using burndowns?
