> _One of the fundamental principles of lean-agile software development is to release early and then in multiple increments. This Demonstration plots the cash flow over time and illustrates three business benefits: sooner break-even, lower investment, higher net return._

The simple model displays as V-shaped curve for each release increment. It assumes initial investment (development of product), then delivery, and steady returns thereafter. The slope of investment and returns depends on cost and value parameters (here these are fixed).

When there are multiple increments, their cumulative total is plotted with break-even point and difference to the baseline highlighted.

The secondary parameter specifies what percentage of the remaining value will be released in the next increment. The default is 50%, which assumes the delivered value is split in half for each of two increments. Smaller percentages lead to flatter returns on initial increments, larger percentages to steeper returns.

These three benefits come from earning returns from the customer sooner due to earlier delivery. The more percentage value per increment can be delivered, the bigger these benefits. (If you look at a set of features, the Pareto principle says that a few of them will deliver most of the value to the customer. That said, the next most desirable features may not be easily identifiable or there may be uneven cost associated with delivering them.)
