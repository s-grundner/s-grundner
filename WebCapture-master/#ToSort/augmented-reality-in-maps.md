Ever wondered what would happen if you were far from a city on an unknown route and wanted to know the nearest restaurant or petrol station? Or if you were lost on an unknown road and anxious to know your exact location?

What you need is a mobile phone or tablet with augmented reality support -- the rest is all set for you.

Over the last decade, mobile AR has evolved greatly. With the passage of time and the transformation and miniaturization of physical devices and displays, the concept of mobile AR has kept pace and evolved with mobile devices.

Launched last year, the new AR feature available for the free subscription of OS Maps follows hot on the heels of the award-winning 3D map and route planning features.

The development team is constantly working to improve OS Maps and more new features. Currently, more than 1.2 million routes are available in the app. Both Landranger and Explorer mapping gives a better excuse to get ready and explore!

Let's explore new features in Google Maps that have certainly eased the job of developers.

  * Recently at I/O, Google showed off new features for Google Maps, and it's interesting to note an augmented reality Street View mode to help users with the real-time directions. This will include personalized recommendations with landmarks, helping to discover neighborhood places.
  * Another exciting feature incorporates the new AR features combined with Google's existing Street View and Maps data. This will allow having a live feed from your phone's camera. Interestingly, this will overlay walking directions on top of the real world, making you understand where way to go.
  * Moreover, apart from directions, the new AR mode allows you to figure out your surroundings more easily. To make directions more clear to users, Google is planning and testing to add a helpful augmented reality animal guide. 
  * Further, Maps is also getting a new tab called "For You". You'll get recommendations specifically customized according to the user's requirement. The new "match number" system will generate a personal score based on your past likes and reviews as well as saved food preferences, contributing to a more personalized recommendation. For instance; Maps will know whether you like ramen or pizza, and later on, based on your reviews it can provide its recommendations.
  * More sharing and caring with Google, as it's adding more social features to Maps. This will enable users to share multiple places with friends using a single action (and in real time vote to decide where to go). This will be done without having to leave the app.
