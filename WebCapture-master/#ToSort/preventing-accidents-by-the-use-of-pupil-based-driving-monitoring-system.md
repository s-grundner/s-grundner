There are a number of reasons why the drivers are either inattentive or distracted and may have different consequences. There are several Driver Monitoring system (DMS) used to measure the driver's fatigue as well as pupil based DMS that takes a different angle at driver's fatigue.

  * Mental overload
  * Cognitive workload.

It comes with a camera to measure the pupil changes and results calculated from the observations.

**Motivation**

DMS is particularly focused on identifying the start of drowsiness in an attempt to lower the incidences of accident from dangerous driving resulting from driver fatigue. It is important for drivers to remain attentive on the road. However, he or she should not be overloaded as it may lead to dangerous driving and accidents.

**The importance of cognitive workload in road traffic**

Cognitive workload is the extent of mental effort in a person. It is equivalent to the CPU. The changes in the pupil movement cannot be discerned by human eye as it is caused by peripheral nervous systems activity. Over time, cognitive workload grows in the head making it hard for drivers to respond well. At the hospital, MRI and ECG measure the cognitive workload. Light also affects the reliability of the measurement as pupil responds to variations to light intensity.

**How cognitive workload is applied in DMS system**

The new DMS system uses the infrared light to capture the driver's pupil movements. The camera is usually placed at the dashboard where the driver's pupil is well monitored.

**Car is attentive when the driver is not**

The system can be connected to the dynamic driving system and Driver assistance system to help the driver in cases of cognitive workload. This may help reduce accidents and incidences of dangerous driving. The pupil based DMS can be seamlessly integrated with the vehicle's infotainment system to give important alerts to the driver when needed. Once the DMS system has found that the driver has high cognitive workload, it may initiate some safety systems to keep the car on track or suggest that he parks on the side for a while. The DMS systems could also be a part of the Advanced Driver Assistance System where the driver could be alerted for collision, moving out of his lane, and when his or her mind is wondering from the road. It could help increase the collision-warning period from three seconds to about four seconds.

**Connection to similar systems**

Several warning systems may be integrated with the pupil monitoring system to warn the drivers when they wonder off from focusing on driving. It can also be integrated with geo-position to identify dangerous road parts. In traffic, the pupil-based DMS system along with Geo-positioning and other navigation technologies could be used to make driving easier by pointing out events ahead on the road such as a construction site, traffic jam, a winding route, slippery road or an accident ahead. This helps the driver seek alternative ahead of time.

**V2V connect between vehicles**

The use of smart technology can help the form Vehicle-to-Vehicle network to help keep all the cars in the vicinity safe. If the system is implemented on several vehicles within a radius, it ensures that no other driver and passengers are at a risk due to one vehicle whose driver is not focusing on the road. However, for the system to be efficient, enough vehicles have to be fitted with the technology and communicate with each other. Data could be exchanged using the cloud connectivity for ease in processing information and reacting to different circumstances.

**You are not being monitored**

The DMS technology is not a big brother scenario and is not used to monitor the actions of the driver for more than his or her security. The system does not send images of the car interior. The camera primary looks at changes in pupils. Moreover, the data corrected is given values of 0 and 1.Several intelligent systems such as blind spot warning, collision warning, and lane assistant are very popular with drivers. This would be an added capability. As much as 43% of drivers are in the favor of semi-autonomous driving and many more would be willing to join the wagon if the benefits of the system becomes more evident and drivers feel safer.
