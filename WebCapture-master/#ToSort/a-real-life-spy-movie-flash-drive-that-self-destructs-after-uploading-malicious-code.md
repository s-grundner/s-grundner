# A Real-Life Spy Movie Flash Drive That Self-Destructs After Uploading Malicious Code

Inspired by a photo of someone cramming a firecracker inside a USB flash drive, a hacker who goes by "[MG](https://medium.com/@_MG_?source=post_header_lockup)" on [Medium](https://medium.com/@_MG_/mr-self-destruct-7986998f32a8) has [detailed a recent project](https://medium.com/@_MG_/mr-self-destruct-7986998f32a8) where he engineered a _Mission Impossible_-style flash drive that ignites and explodes after delivering a nefarious software payload onto an unsuspecting computer.

Or at least they detailed _most_ of the build, which involves cramming an Arduino-compatible ATtiny85 chip (and other electronics) into the gutted housing of a USB flash drive. That turns it into what's known as a [USB Rubber Ducky](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) that can deliver keystroke commands and malicious code because a computer thinks it's a normal keyboard when plugged in.

What MG doesn't detail in their [Medium post](https://medium.com/@_MG_/mr-self-destruct-7986998f32a8) is how the flash drive goes from emulating a keyboard to triggering a [small explosive device](https://vimeo.com/239761255) inside to effectively destroy itself, and any incriminating evidence, when its software-delivery job is complete. Teaching the internet how to build such a device would almost certainly lead to a run-in with the law some day. So instead, let the moral of this hack be to just stop using mysterious flash drives which may or may not be hiding a tiny bomb.
