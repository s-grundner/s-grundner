**1\. Collection vs Collections**

First of all, "Collection" and "Collections" are two different concepts. As you will see from the hierarchy diagram below, "Collection" is a root interface in the Collection hierarchy but "Collections" is a class which provide static methods to manipulate on some Collection types.

**5\. Code Example**

The following is a simple example to illustrate some collection types:

Output:
    
    
    ArrayList Elements
    	[Program, Creek, Java, Java]
    LinkedList Elements
    	[Program, Creek, Java, Java]
    Set Elements
    	[tutorial, Creek, Program, Java]
    Map Elements
    	{Windows=XP, Website=programcreek.com, Language=Java}
