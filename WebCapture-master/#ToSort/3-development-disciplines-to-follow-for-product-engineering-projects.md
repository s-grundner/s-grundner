A recent study shows that 40% of system failures are due to software bugs and concurrency related issues. This makes software less reliable and more vulnerable. You would not like to fall prey to these, right?

The general consideration is that if you have domain or technology expertise, you are ready to develop a software project, which I feel is a completely wrong understanding. Software products may be a project for you but it acts as a lifeline for your clients. You would not like to make them unhappy. To succeed, you must focus on outcome and not output.

An output is about delivering something that has been promised, while an outcome is about asking yourself, is the software really worth it? I am sure everyone in this competitive world would like to focus on the outcome. To be right up there, you need to adopt some discipline. Considering a project as your own will help you with that. Let us look at some disciplines that make it happen.

## **Use BDD or TDD**

Business-Driven Development (BDD) or Test-Driven Development (TDD) are popular approaches to consider for a project on hand. BDD is about involving the client at every stage of development to understand the behavior of a function that is to be developed. TDD is used for a straightforward project where you define test cases at the beginning and develop a product to align it with these cases. Both have pros and cons, so it is up to you to select the right approach for an upcoming product engineering project.

Why use BDD or TDD? Wouldn't you love to deliver a project that delights your client? Yes, for sure! Then this is the right way to stay informed on what you are working on and why you are developing a specific feature.

## **Use of Methodology**

As per Wikipedia, software development methodology is the splitting of software development work into distinct phases (or stages) containing activities with the intent of better planning and management. What does this mean to you?

Being a software development company, you adopt processes that help you deliver reliable software projects. But how? Methodologies help you break down a complex project into small deliverables that help them focus on results. You develop a project function-by-function, module-by-module and then combine them to bring the best to the table. Popular methodologies include Agile scrum, Kanban, and waterfall.

## **Commitment to Support for Product Success**

Every finished software product is considered a beta version until a client tests it thoroughly. There are very few occasions when a product is foolproof and does not require any change. Also, along its journey, a client may think of enhancements. This is where your commitment to stand with them for the long haul makes a difference. You take ownership of a product and work on it until it is ready to take on any challenge.

Your role as software/product engineering in a development company is crucial. Adopting these disciplines will make the journey smooth. With these tactics, you are bound to get best projects and build everlasting relationships with your clients who will serve as your major income source.
