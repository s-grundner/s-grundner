The technology transformation is never-ending and competes with itself to revitalize and move ahead for an enhanced experience.

Today, automakers, software developers, and technology companies are leading a transformation in the automotive industry, endeavoring to redefine the existing technology. This will cultivate innovative concepts leveraging connected car and Artificial Intelligence to render driving experience (that is beyond imagination). For instance -- technology can enable vehicles, detect driving patterns, along with understanding emotions. This can guide drivers for a safe and enhanced experience.

Hence, it is essential to conclude mobility services as the new frontier for smarter transportation is justified. More auto companies are looking to grab the emerging opportunity by digitally integrating to establish a new experience for the people around them.

With the robust emergence of IoT, emphasizing on developing new ecosystems is crucial to understand how transforming the Internet of Things will be well worth the endeavor.

## Future Assumption

An entirely autonomous car will have the feature to transport a person without driver oversight ( with no attention to the road required). The vehicle will have all the entertainment, information, and connection with the outside world (that someone would have in their home, office). For instance, from the temperature of the interior to the tinting of the windows, it will be able to prevent glare, establish personalized adjustments of ambient lighting to create the perfect mood, and to play music through the satellite radio station.

Even if the car is not driverless, the driver is still connected with the world around them through a digital cockpit platform with sensors positioned around the car to provide a cocoon of safety in the thickest of traffic.

Assumptions are such that in future, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology will facilitate communication between the cars and infrastructure, like traffic lights. This will help to adjust vehicle speed and the distance by analyzing the conditions on the road.

Further, the voice recognition can be used by the drivers to communicate with a virtual personal assistant to schedule meetings and send text messages. The vehicle's navigation system guides the car through traffic.

In addition, technologies like GPS navigation system, rear-view cameras, and keyless ignitions, improves the driving experience. More importantly, connectivity is a crucial aspect of both autonomous vehicle and smart cities. As per a recent survey by Automotive Product Development and Launch Cycles, 53 percent of respondents confirmed that better connectivity is key for technology innovation. In the automobile, most of the technologies advances are focused to make vehicles safer integrating GPS navigation for user convenience.

Furthermore, the emergence of safety-centric technologies will be focusing to reduce the human element from the operation, allowing the automobile companies to build unified, fully-integrated, and personalized vehicle experience. The connected car will change the existing way of how people use to drive. Electric and driverless cars, the advanced AI technology, increased application of environment sensors with an onboard computer system, and connectivity of Wi-Fi through digital platforms are paving the future.

Let's have a look at the most talked trends that are shaping the way the automobile will take the road.

## Driverless Cars

Today, automotive and technology companies are keen on building the driverless car.

Considered a huge game changer, the driverless car will be widely popular. However, the acceptance and production of driverless cars will require a connected infrastructure and advancement of other technologies, such as V2V. Hence, it will take years to successfully implement this concept.

## Vehicle-to-Vehicle Connectivity

As the name suggests, the V2V allows the vehicle on the road to communicate with each other via data like speed, temperature, road condition, and other emergency networks. The technology promises advanced scenario like uncertain crashes to check, ease of traffic congestion, and improved environment.

It is expected that by 2023 all new cars will come with integrated V2V technology.

## Sensor Application

Innovative sensors monitor and regulate a car's operation and provide the foundation for autonomous driving by sharing important data in demanding applications, such as engines and brake and transmission systems.

In the years to come, sensors such as LiDAR, radar, cameras, and ultrasonic are expected to impact safety, security, and vehicle maintenance costs. The future for sensors will continue to soar, as they are integrated into AI and connected car technologies to explore further possibilities.

## Conclusion

In the future, all the cars will be connected digitally. Today, some of the premium model vehicles and luxury cars are built with in-vehicle wireless connectivity. The concept of the connected car will be paving huge opportunities for designers, app developers, and web developers. And, the first step towards the connected car is to focus on the car-to-mobile connection that will spread to the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connection.
