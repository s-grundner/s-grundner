When you own where you live, the sky is the limit for home automation. On the other hand, if you rent, your landlord would likely not appreciate you ripping up the walls to install your own homebrew lighting control system.

In order to solve this very minor problem, hacker Will Donaldson came up with [a unique and admittedly over-engineered electromechanical device](https://www.instructables.com/id/Remote-Control-Bluetooth-Light-Switch/) that physically flicks a switch with a micro servo, and mounts using standard faceplate screws.

> _Too lazy to get out of bed? This remote-controlled system uses a pair of Bluetooth modules, two ATtiny85s, and a servo to turn a light switch on/off._

The fixture is controlled via Bluetooth, and uses a custom remote with two simple buttons for on and off. Both the remote and actuator are driven by [ATtiny85 chips](https://www.hackster.io/microchip/products/attiny85), and the device cleverly comes to rest in a neutral position, allowing manual switch operation if needed.
