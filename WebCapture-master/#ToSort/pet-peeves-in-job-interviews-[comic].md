We already discussed in a [previous post](https://www.typemock.com/weird-interviews-programmers-must-endure/) weak excuses for not showing up in an interview. Let's have a look at memorable interviews that actually do take place. Here is an overview of the [oddest scenarios](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/interview-mistakes.aspx):

  * Taken a family photo off the interviewer's desk and put it into her purse.

  * Started screaming that the interview was taking too long.

  * Sung her responses to questions.

  * Put lotion on her feet during the interview. (Seriously?!?!?)

  * Started feeling the interviewer's chest to find a heartbeat so the two of them could "connect heart to heart."

  * Conducted a phone interview in the bathroom-and flushed.

  * Said "painter of birdhouses" when asked what his/her ideal job was. (The company was hiring for a data entry clerk.)

  * Had a pet bird in his/her shirt.

  * Spread confetti around during the interview.
