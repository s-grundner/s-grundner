_Why "57.2958..." degrees?_ We will see in a moment.

The **Radian** is a pure measure based on the **Radius** of the circle:

**Radian**: the angle made when we take the **radius**   
and wrap it round the circle.

## Radians and Degrees 

Let us see why 1 Radian is equal to 57.2958... degrees:

![radius of 1, pi is half of circumference](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/images/pi-circle.gif)

In a half circle there are π radians, which is also 180°

So:
π radians 
= 
180°

So:
1 radian 
= 
180°/π

= 
57.2958...°

(approximately)

To go from **radians to degrees**: multiply by 180, divide by π

To go from **degrees to radians**: multiply by π, divide by 180

### Example: How Many Radians in a [Full Circle](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/full-rotation.html)? 

Imagine you cut up pieces of string exactly the length from the **center to the circumference of a circle** ...

... how many pieces do you need to go **once around ** the circle?

Answer: 2π (or about **6.283** pieces of string).

## Radians Preferred by Mathematicians

Because the radian is based on the pure idea of _"the radius being laid along the circumference_", it often gives simple and natural results when used in mathematics.

**For example**, look at the [sine function](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sine-cosine-tangent.html) for very small values:

x (radians)
1
0.1
0.01
0.001

sin(x)
0.8414710
0.0998334
0.0099998
0.0009999998

For very small values. "x" and "sin(x)" are almost the same  
(as long as "x" is in Radians!)

There will be other examples like that as you learn more about mathematics.

## Conclusion

So, degrees are easier to use in everyday work, but radians are much better for mathematics.
