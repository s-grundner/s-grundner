## Introduction

Python is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and has replaced many programming languages in the industry.

There are many reasons why Python is popular among developers. However, one of the most significant is its large collection of libraries that users can work with.

The simplicity of Python has attracted many developers to create new libraries for machine learning. Because of the huge collection of libraries, Python is becoming hugely popular among machine learning experts.

So, the first library is TensorFlow.

## TensorFlow

### **What Is TensorFlow?**

If you are currently working on a machine learning project in Python, then you may have heard about this popular open-source library known as TensorFlow.

This library was developed by Google in collaboration with the Brain Team. TensorFlow is used in almost every Google application for machine learning.

TensorFlow works like a computational library for writing new algorithms that involve a large number of tensor operations. Since neural networks can be easily expressed as computational graphs, they can be implemented using TensorFlow as a series of operations on Tensors. Plus, tensors are N-dimensional matrices that represent your data.

### **Features of TensorFlow**

TensorFlow is optimized for speed, and it makes use of techniques like XLA for quick linear algebra operations.

**1\. Responsive Construct**

With TensorFlow, we can easily visualize each and every part of the graph, which is not an option while using _Numpy_ or_ SciKit_.

**2\. Flexible**

One of the very important Tensorflow Features is that it is flexible in its operability, meaning it has modularity, and for the parts of it that you want to make stand alone, it offers you that option.

**3\. Easily Trainable**

It is easily trainable on CPU as well as _GPU_ for distributed computing.

**4\. Parallel Neural Network Training**

TensorFlow offers pipelining, in the sense that you can train multiple_ neural networks _and multiple GPUs, which makes the models very efficient on large-scale systems.

**5\. Large Community**

Needless to say, if it has been developed by Google, there is already a large team of software engineers who work on stability improvements continuously.

**6\. Open Source**

The best thing about this machine learning library is that it is open source, so anyone can use it as long as they have internet connectivity.

### **Where Is TensorFlow Used?**

You are using TensorFlow daily but indirectly with applications like Google Voice Search or Google Photos. These applications are developed using this library.

All the libraries created in TensorFlow are written in C and C++. However, it has a complicated frontend for Python. Your Python code will get compiled and then executed on TensorFlow distributed execution engine built using C and C++.

The number of applications of TensorFlow is literally unlimited, and that is the beauty of TensorFlow.

The improvements in Pandas are its ability to group and sort data, select the best-suited output for the applied method, and provide support for performing custom types operations.

Data Analysis, among everything else, takes the highlight when it comes to using Pandas. But when used with other libraries and tools, Pandas ensures high functionality and a good amount of flexibility.

That's it, folks! I hope this article helped you kickstart your learning the libraries available in Python.
