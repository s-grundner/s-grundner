In this easy-to-build project, I show you how to flash holiday lights to music with a solid state relay, a pair of speakers, and some loose wire. The relay acts as a switch and connects your lights to power whenever the speaker voltage goes above a certain threshold. Follow this short step-by-step video to see how it's done. A wiring diagram will be provided in a section below.

I'd recommend at least covering any exposed wires to prevent accident electrical shock. I didn't have time, but you could also build a wooden speaker box to house the loose electronics.

Happy Holidays!
