Many of you know I'm a Markdown fanatic.

## Not sure what Markdown is?

Markdown is a plain text markup language that works like the typing class conventions I learned in high school (on a typewriter). The cool part is that it converts that text into perfect (and accessible) HTML. It was conceived by [John Gruber](http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/4ca48e6f7f8b9a37500e0300/apple-fan-john-gruber-windows-phone-7-really-nice-and-better-than-android.jpg), the Apple pundit. You can find the whole history at his site [Daring Fireball.](http://daringfireball.net/)

You can write in Markdown with any text editor. There are conversion apps like [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) and also many web service for free like [Markable.in](http://markable.in/). (Markable has the holy grail of Markdown to Evernote integration) In addition many of these conversion tools will convert to PDF and RTF for the print world.

## Markdownify-ing

Markdownifying lets you submit a URL and get back the html rendered back as Markdown. For the person who doesn't like to get their feet wet with html it's a great way to edit a page.

Why not use something like Dreamweaver? It's complex, let's you get into trouble with too many formatting options (like MS-Word) that end up making bloated and often unaccessible pages.

Here's the Markdownifier link.

Brett Terpstra, the talented man that wrote this also makes a bookmarklet called "[Bullseye"](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/07/30/precise-web-clipping-to-markdown-with-bullseye/) that does the same sort of thing but lets you grab specific parts of the page you currently on and bounces that to Markdown.

Go check out these tools. Take some time to ponder what they can do in your workflow. For writers that straddle print and digital Markdown is a strong contender for your home base.
