Dealing with work complexity has become a major leadership development issue. And it is a challenge that has ethical implications. As our work becomes more complex, so do our ethical dilemmas.

**What is Thinking Complexity?**

We may want to lead responsibly but still struggle to make ethical decisions in highly complex situations. It would help if we could develop the thinking skills to navigate those situations more easily. If we were prepared to think at a high degree of complexity, we would be better able to understand the organization and its challenges from multiple perspectives when making difficult decisions.

> "If managers and leaders are to scratch beneath the surface and delve into the substance of their organizations, what is needed is "cognitive complexity" which can be defined as "_the intellectual ability of a manager or leader to envision the organization from multiple and competing perspectives so as to develop a depth of organizational understanding that is at least equal to the factors impacting its functioning_."

Considering multiple perspectives in decision-making provides an advantage to leaders and organizations as they juggle competing demands. How can we prepare leaders to do that?

**Preparing Leaders**

We are going to need to improve our thinking skills to be ready to deal with the increasing complexity of work in our networked global society. According to Nick Petrie, Center for Creative Leadership, we will need a completely new approach to developing leaders in order to deal with the level of change that is coming.

> "There is one thing that I have become certain of and that is that the methods that have been used in the past to develop leaders really, truly, categorically will not be enough for the complexity of challenges which are on their way for organizations (and broader society)."
> 
> Nick Petrie, [Future Trends in Leadership Development](http://www.ccl.org/leadership/pdf/research/futureTrends.pdf), Center for Creative Leadership

The ability to think through complex problems clearly is an asset to individual leaders and to the organizations they serve. We need to find ways to help leaders develop this ability, and to do that, it helps to understand what it is that leaders with a high degree of thinking complexity do.

**What Do Leaders With High Thinking Complexity Do?**

As you review this list, _consider how you can seek meaningful leadership development experiences that support these practices._

_**Think in Multiple Dimensions and in Relationships**_

> "Persons who are high in cognitive complexity are able to analyze (i.e., differentiate) a situation into many constituent elements, and then explore connections and potential relationships among the elements; they are multidimensional in their thinking."
> 
> Streufert, S., & Swezey, R. W. (1986). Complexity, managers, and organizations. New York: Academic Press, online at The College of St. Scholastica

_**Deal Well With Ambiguity and Contradictory Findings **_

> "There are numerous studies which suggest that individuals who have high cognitive complexity tend to be more tolerant of ambiguity, more comfortable not only with new findings but even with contradictory findings. Moreover, such individuals have a greater ability to observe the world in terms of grey rather than simply in terms of black and white."

**_Use Systems Thinking_**

> "To meet the needs of requisite complexity, Knowledge Era leadership requires a change in thinking away from individual, controlling views, and toward views of organizations as complex adaptive systems that enable continuous creation and capture of knowledge."

_**Intentionally Seek and Integrate New Information**_

> "Complex people tend to be more open to new information, rely on their own integrative efforts than new information, seek more novel information, search across more categories of information, and are less externally information bound. They tend to take in more information and form more well rounded impressions than less complex persons."

> Streufert, S., & Swezey, R. W. [Complexity, managers, and organizations](http://lindafisherthornton.wordpress.com/wp-admin/Academic%20Press). New York: Academic Press, online at The College of St. Scholastica

_**Connect Employees, Processes and Tools to Meet Goals**_

> Ultimately, these women and men - armed with cognitive complexity and the skills and techniques associated with best practice - will manage and lead their organizations to achieve their goals by uniting people, technology and process in a more efficient and effective _human_ way.
> 
> Richard Jacobs, [Analyzing Organizations Through Cognitive Complexity](http://www83.homepage.villanova.edu/richard.jacobs/MPA%208002/Powerpoint/cogcomp/index.html), Villanova University

**_Simplify Complexity For Those They Lead_**

> Those leaders of the units judged to be 'most successful' were not those who demonstrated the higher levels of systemic thinking but, rather, seemed able to simplify complexity for their teams.
> 
> Keith Normal Johnston, [Complexity of thinking and levels of self-complexity required to sustainably manage the environment](http://leadingincontext.com/2013/02/27/dealing-with-complexity-in-leadership/Those%20leaders%20of%20the%20units%20judged%20to%20be%20‘most%20successful’%20were%20not%20those%20who%20demonstrated%20the%20higher%20levels%20of%20systemic%20thinking%20but,%20rather,%20seemed%20able%20to%20simplify%20complexity%20for%20their%20teams.), thesis submitted to Australian National University

Leaders who develop a high level of thinking complexity will be better able to help our organizations understand and work through a wide variety of challenges, problems and opportunities. They will make sense out of issues and problems that are multidimensional and connected. And they will be prepared to do what all great leaders do - help those they lead deal with increasing complexity.
