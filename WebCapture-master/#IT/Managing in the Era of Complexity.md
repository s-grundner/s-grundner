**Our question – Drucker in Practice**: ***How do I work with Peter Drucker's ideas?***

`Complexity := Theory <> practice ?`

* The starting point of most of our members: **modern production systems**
	* How do management thinkers explain complex production systems?

> "My biggest problem was, that I had to hire whole people, when all I needed was two hands." _Henry Ford, 1910_

> "Toyota operates exactly the way Drucker-san said a company ought to operate." _Prof. Atsuo Ueda - President Drucker Society of Japan DW_

> "The TPS is a management philosophy […], [It ] has a lot in common with Professor Drucker's teachings." _Shoichiro Toyoda, Drucker Society of Japan DW_

> Employees as ... talent!   ... problem solvers! "Workers have brains! Workers have ideas!" _Ron McPherson, 1980 to Tom Peters - CEO Dana, auto-parts manufacturer_

> Taylor's production system: "To separate thinking from acting"

> Taylor's blind spots: "If you separate the working process, to separate workers as much as possible"

1. What is complexity?
2. How do leadership-masters deal with complexity?
3. Why managers can't simplify?

## What is complexity?

* Science and Complexity: one of the most intriguing discoveries of scientific discourse
	* quantum physics 1920s
	* cybernetics 1940s
	* management 1940s 
* complicated? you can keep track of it logically connected

Complexity means:

* An observer is overtaxed if having to understand a phenomenon
* Complex phenomena consisting of many (more thanthree or four) organized, heterogeneous elements defy both causality and statistics

* Chess: 10^120 possible games (Chess Grand Master)
	* strategic plan?
	* build up the game?
* Universe: 10^80 atoms

* Organizations are as complex as chess because they are social systems acting in an unexpectable environment

* "Management becomes necessary when an organization reaches a certain size and complexity." _Peter Drucker_

* "For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle." _Herbert A. Simon - The Proverbs of Administration, 1946_

* "To manage = to deal with contradictions" _Herbert A. Simon - The Proverbs of Administration, 1946_

* Contradictory principles: Reduce complexity! <> Build up the game!

* The function of management "to put knowledge to work" _Peter Drucker_

* How "to put knowledge to work"? Reduce complexity!

* "An organization is a tool. And as with any other tool, the more specialized it is, the greater its capacity to perform its given task."

* "The organization must be single-minded, or its members become confused. Only a focused and common mission will hold the organization together and enable it to produce."

* "Focus on simple and understandable products or services."

* _Peter Drucker_
	* What is our mission?
	* Who is our customer?
	* What does the customer value?
	* What are our results?
	* What is our plan?

* Contradictory principle: Build up the game!

* Peter Drucker calls himself a `social ecologist`. He builds up the game by:
	* analyzing history
	* communicating, networking and "buzzing around"
	* observing "look out the window"

## Understanding complexity?

* Managing in the past society: who works, plans out and produces?

* Managing in the next society: who works communicates!

## Peter Drucker's landmarks: How to deal with complexity?

* Management by ...?
* One best way?
* To-do-lists?
* Either ... or?
* observing and epigrams!

* How to deal with complexity? Build up the game with epigrams!

### [epigram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigram)

An epigram is a brief, interesting, memorable, and sometimes surprising or satirical statement. Derived from the Greek: ἐπίγραμμα epigramma "inscription" from ἐπιγράφειν epigraphein "to write on, to inscribe",[1] this literary device has been employed for over two millennia.

* Organizations: "To create a customer"

* Classical production systems: "To separate thinking from acting"

* "You cannot manage other people unless you manage yourself first."

* knowledge workers
	* They *may not* have to be "managed",
	* but they have to *be made* "productive".
	* They have to be *treated* as "volunteers".

* **change**: "The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create it"

## Why managers can't simplify?

* "Act always as to increase the number of choices" _Heinz von Foerster_

## Simple vs. Complex


|  | Simple Management Perspective | Complex Management Perspective |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Problem | non-consistency | inconclusive situation |
| Solution | one best way - to-do-lists | unorthodoxy - "complicate yourself!" |
| Change | linear - either ... or | circular - as well as |
| Image of Crisis | crisis is explainable - call a consultant | crisis means re-organizing - self organizing system |
| Decision | based on calculation | based on judgement |
| Reasoning | formal, fixed rules | informal, variable rules |
| Focus| reduce complexity | build up the game |
