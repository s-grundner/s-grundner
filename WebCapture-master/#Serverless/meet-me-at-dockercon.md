# Meet me at Dockercon

_Captured: 2017-08-29 at 10:27 from [blog.alexellis.io](https://blog.alexellis.io/meet-me-at-dockercon/)_

Dockercon is fast approaching and all the weeks of work have finally started to pay off. I'm now an Official [Docker Captain](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains) and I've got two speaking slots including one very special technical demo. I show off how Docker can meld-together real world sensors with IoT and micro services to create something awesome.

**Come over and say hello** if you see me at Dockercon. You can also come by and ask questions at one of the sessions below:

**Here I am preparing my technical demo for talk #2**

#### My schedule

**Talk #2 Docker and IoT securing the server-room with realtime microservices**

When: Tuesday PM

> In this hack, we secure the data-center through a scaleable network of real-time sensors and microservices running Docker. Each rack in the server-room is filled with thousands of terabytes of priceless customer data, IoT lets us keep one step ahead and keep that data safe. The cluster deploys a set of smart sensors running the Docker Swarm agent to the rack panels.
> 
> Each sensor constantly samples the ambient temperature of the rack and sends a real-time alarm to the control room when levels rise above normal levels. An anti-tamper motion sensor picks up tiny vibrations and alerts the admins when someone is performing unscheduled maintenance on the equipment. A custom made RGB LED display made by Pimoroni for Dockercon shows the status of up to 8 racks in real-time.

Head over to the Github page for some sneak preview videos and all the source code.

**Talk #1: Meet the Docker Captains! with Alex Ellis, Laura Frank and Nirmal Mehta**

When: Monday PM

> During this interactive session, members of the Docker Captain program will discuss their Docker journey along with how they became industry-recognized Docker experts. Alex, Laura and Nirmal will share their experiences as Docker Captains and provide recommendations on how to become more involved with your local community.

#### See you there!

I'm looking forward to meeting the Docker team, the other Captains and hearing all the great new announcements.

_I'm in Seattle already - kit for the demo has survived transit._
