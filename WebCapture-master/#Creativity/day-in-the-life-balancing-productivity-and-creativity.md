# Day In The Life: Balancing Productivity And Creativity

Once I've consumed enough coffee and I'm starting to see clearly, I sat down to create my to-do list for the day. Each week I set goals for what I'd like to accomplish and every morning I break those goals down into doable, daily chunks. The productivity tool that I swear by is the Pomodoro timer. It works by requiring that you focus completely on one activity for 25 minutes at a time, which is followed by a 5 minute break. I now break down my to-do list into the number of pomodoros I have to get done in a day. I try to set up my day so my most important to-do's are done before lunch, but I'd say that still only happens about 60% of the time.

Once I'm done making my list, I head out of my flat for yet another cup of coffee. When I worked in an office I used the commute as a way to mentally get ready for the day, but now that I work from home I still need that time to prep for what's ahead. I now use my walk for coffee as a sort of commute. It also helps me to make sure I get out of my yoga pants and into real clothes, which I swear does wonders for my productivity. I'm home and sitting at my desk working away with my pomodoro timer by 7:30 am.

After a long morning of tackling my to-do list, I head out to meet a client for lunch. If I don't have a client meeting I usually spend the afternoon out of the house anyway, to get a change of scenery and focus on more creative endeavors. Today I'm finishing a presentation for the client while sitting on the tube. It sounds weird but I get some of my best work done on public transportation. On days that I'm in a creative slump, I've been tempted to hop on a bus (the double decker ones here in London) and just type away as we roll through the city.

I usually take an afternoon break around 2pm to head to the gym, but my meeting today went a bit long and I really wanted to take advantage of the last days of sunny weather in London. I grabbed my dog, Hattie, and headed to Holland Park for a long stroll. Getting this space outside helped me to work through some of the ideas that came up during the meeting today and also helped me decompress so I could be fresh for a podcast interview at 5 pm.

Wrapped up a podcast interview and I'm pretty excited about it! I think getting out for a walk with Hattie helped to get me get my energy up late in the afternoon. I had one lingering to-do from my list this morning that I finished up (it only took 1 pomodoro) and then I headed out for dinner at an Indian restaurant with my husband and two friends. Even though I don't have coworkers, I seem to always have a day full of talking with people.

After dinner I walked home along the embankment in London taking in the sights at night. I've lived here for 3 years and this view still never gets old. It would have been faster to take the tube home, but I'm trying to make sure I keep the creative and productive balance, and walking home on a beautiful fall evening was just what I needed in order to reset for tomorrow.

People often ask me if it's hard to be productive working from home, without a real boss, and without a real schedule.

Yes. Yes, it is hard. But what I find most difficult is balancing productivity and creativity.

I consider myself a productive person, but if I'm not careful my day can slip away, my productivity can dwindle, and as a result, my paycheck takes a dive. So much of my day involves creating new ideas, which seem to develop best when I'm out from behind my computer screen, so while chaining myself to my desk may help my productivity, it hurts my creativity.

I've found a balance (for now) that has me feeling incredibly productive and creative at the same time.

Here's a day last week in my newly balanced life.

**5:15 am:** Wake up and get my day started with a green smoothie, a quick walk with my dog, and a lot of coffee. A lot. I've learned that I'm the most productive early in the morning, before the city wakes up and gets noisy. But honestly, when this alarm goes off every morning I still struggle to pull myself out of bed.
