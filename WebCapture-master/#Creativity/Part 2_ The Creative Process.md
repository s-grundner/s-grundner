> _Let's think a little more on this questionâ€¦._

#### Should we measure creativity?

As an educator in Ontario, Canada, I feel it is important to begin with our curriculum documents. Our system has been commended by many worldwide and yet when we are in it, we don't always see our strengths, and I believe that our curriculum documents offer more flexibility and personalization to support creativity than we realize. So often we begin with a criticism of these documents as many educators focus on the expectations as a checklist rather than reading the contextual front matter of these documents to understand the nature of the content and how to use it grounded in a very particular philosophy.

In the Ontario Arts Curriculum, the creative process is outlined as central to arts instruction and assessment. This process can be adapted for ALL learning, across subject areas and encouraging an integrative and interdisciplinary approach.

> _"The creative process is intended to be followed in a flexible, fluid, and cyclical manner." (p 20) From the Ontario Elementary Arts Curriculum: https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18b09curr.pdf_

The chart below outlines what the role of the student and teacher are at each phase of the creative process, understanding that the stages don't necessarily start in one place, nor does the learner necessarily always move forward but rather back and forth in a cyclical movement with feedback and reflection at each stage.

Reviewing the chart shows that the student and teacher have distinct roles to extend and support creative thinking, learning, and risk taking.

The **student** uses creative ideas, participates in planning, articulates and discusses ideas with others, makes choices in response to challenges, identifies an audience and reflects on the learning.

The **teacher** introduces ideas, challenges and inspirations, models, defines, questions, structures learning, provides descriptive feedback, encourages communication of ideas, makes connections, provides time for reflection and promotes collaboration.

There are aspects to both the role of the student and the role of the teacher that shift throughout the learning process.

If the arts content was removed from this process and problem solving in mathematics, experiments in science, or critical thinking in language or history was the content, the process would still support learning.

This doesn't just happen. It takes more than reading the front matter of the Ontario Curriculum. There is a theme that runs through all creative work be in the arts, education, or any innovation -- the atmosphere where discourse and risk taking are valued and central to the process.

> Teachers need to be aware that the atmosphere they create for learning affects the nature of the learning itself. A setting that is conducive to creativity is one in which students are not afraid to suggest alternative ideas and take risks. (Ontario Elementary Arts Curriculum, p 19)

Further to the culture that exists in any creative setting is the willingness to provide feedback and consider feedback through a reflective and iterative process for learning.

> Ongoing feedback and structured opportunities for students to engage in reflection and metacognition -- for example, reflecting on strengths, areas for improvement, and alter- native possibilities, and setting goals and identifying strategies for achieving their goals -- are woven into each stage of the creative process. In this way, assessment by both teacher and student is used to inspire students' creativity and support their development and achievement in the arts. (Ontario Elementary Arts Curriculum, p 21)

Here is a video exemplifying what the creative process looks like in an elementary drama classroom:

**This is what learning looks like.**

#### Let's also consider a creative process in the creative world outside of K-12 education:

One of my favourite blogs is [Brain Pickings](http://@brainpickings) by [Maria Popova](https://medium.com/u/964fe4a6b632). In her blog, she synthesizes the ideas of many voices to bring together an idea in new and creative ways. In this particular blog, [The 1o Stages of the Creative Process](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/19/tiffany-shlain-creative-process/), she references several creatives including [Neil Gaiman](https://medium.com/u/3e427e04acbd), Graham Wallace, John Dewey, TS Eliot and [Tiffany Shlain](https://medium.com/u/bd26e45a3b0a)'s video:

There are themes that run through both the K-12 example as well as the creative process example in the film industry -- challenges, communication, collaboration, problem solving, risk taking, feedback, reflection.

Both creative processes build towards deeper learning, expression and fulfillment.

> The arts can play a key role in shaping students' views about life and learning. Since the arts exist in a broader social and historical context, teachers can show students that all of the arts are affected by the values and choices of individuals, and in turn have a significant impact on society. (Ontario Elementary Arts Curriculum, p 8)

Can we say the same for other areas of schooling? Do languages, history, science, mathematics, physical education, design and technology, or any other subject area "play a key role in shaping students' views about life and learning"?

If a child is graded in a way that tells them their thinking doesn't fit, isn't right, or didn't follow the rules we have outlined by our grading systems, doesn't that teach her or him something profound about life and learning?

If instead, we create environments that nurture risk taking, experimentation, and problem solving where a variety of experiences as well as divergent, integrative, and creative thinking are valued, doesn't that teach him or her something completely different?

Which environment would you prefer to build? In which environment would you prefer to work? Which environment would you prefer to have your own child learn? In fact, which environment is a learning environment and which is one based on compliance?
