So you've been thinking up new ideas. You like the thousands of other people out there want to go out and start something new, something different, something of your own. You have been bitten by the startup bug.

When that happens it develops an itch within you, a restlessness to innovate and create. And then you start ideating. Dreaming of what could be possible, and just like everyone you will draw up a list of ideas. From the just another ecommerce or hyperlocal idea to the next Uber. An idea set for failure or to be a unicorn. But now what? How to choose which one to pick, to dedicate yourself to?

I have spent the last one year thinking, ideating, brainstorming and then subjecting various of these to the usual tests.

  * Does it solve a problem?
  * Is it the best solution for that problem?
  * Will people pay for this solution?
  * How big is the problem?
  * Can the solution scale?
  * What could be the business model?
  * Is there someone already doing something like this?
  * Is it a need or a want?
  * The framework of the who, what, why, where, when and how of it.
  * Can I make it work?
  * What is the wow factor? What will make my customer go wow?
  * Surveying people to know what they think about it.

All of these are filters to pass your idea through. To gauge if it has potential before you give up your job or whatever else to work on it. But there is one more factor to this equation of potential success and it is the most important one.

> **Does it make your heartbeat faster?** Everytime when you think of it, get lost in the thoughts of its possibilities, talk about it with someone, do you feel the blood rushing through you and the fist sized organ beating against your ribcage, making you feel like leaving everything else and just diving straight into it? That truly is the right idea. One which you can dedicate the rest of your life to, one that has passion written all over it!

So did you find it, **yet?**

Thank you for reading this. This is my second article after months of thinking of starting to write. Would love to know what you think about it and your experience of finding thr right idea. Do share and recommend if it added some value to you.
