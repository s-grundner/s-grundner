_"It's impossible to explain creativity. It's like asking a bird, 'How do you fly?' You just do." (c) Eric Jerome Dickey_

There is no specific definition of creativity, as everyone sees and feels it slightly different from each other. In parallel, defining creativity is similar to defining love, everyone has their own perception of it and it is difficult to capture the true sense of it, unless you have felt it. However, looking at the literature and famous people quotations, majority agrees that creativity is thinking outside of the box, an act of turning new and original ideas into reality. Some of the world's greatest men have made an attempt to define this complicated concept and here is my personal selection of a few quotes that assist in developing a brief understanding of creativity concept.

> "_Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way" (c)Edward de Bono_

> "_Creativity is defined as the tendency to generate or recognize ideas, alternatives, or possibilities that may be useful in solving problems, communicating with others, and entertaining ourselves and others" (c)Robert E. Franken_

> "_Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new oneâ€¦What counts is whether the novelty he or she produces is accepted for inclusion in the domain" (c) Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi_

> "_Creativity is seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else had thought." (c) Albert Einstein_

> _"Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity" (c) Charles Mingus_

Needless to say that in the modern society, full with the abundance of choice and fierce competition, creativity plays a significant role. Especially in marketing, where creativity is viewed widely as a way of solving complex problems for the benefit of the company. Indeed, creativity in organisation's marketing communication is one of the greatest tools to achieve differentiation and competitive advantage, as it helps to reinforce the brand's message, inform and grab the attention of people and more effectively persuade audiences to behave in a particular way that a company wants. There are countless examples in the marketplace proving that innovation and creative thinking leads to brand's success on a wider scale. Though the question arises-- what is creativity?

I believe that creativity is about the originality and novelty of ideas, it is a process of breaking out of established patterns in order to find new solutions to problem solving in a simple manner. According to Csikszentmihalyi (1997) creativity drives from the state of flow, hence a creative person needs to have high knowledge in the field, as well as high skill competence (talent) in order to produce something highly creative. He also needs to be passionate about the idea/act/product. Therefore, it can be argued that creativity is about following your emotional self and forgetting about the rational self for a while. Albert Einstein once told: "_Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere". _In order to create something truly innovative, people need to let go the rational thinking for a while and focus on the lead of their imagination, which is an important component of creativity.

However, there is always an element of risk of failure and some studies indicated that an overly-excessive creative campaign might actually do company more harm than good. But if a marketer truly understands the target audience that leap of faith needs to be taken to produce something outstanding and become a market leader in the sector.
