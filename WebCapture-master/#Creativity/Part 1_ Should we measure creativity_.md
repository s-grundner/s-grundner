> _When I drew this my husband thought it was viruses, a friend thought it was a series of kepahs (the head covering Jewish men wear) and still others thought it was something else. Does it matter what it is? Doesn't mean more to create something that others see something in?_

> _Max is 21 months old here drawing with Rachel. He could sit quietly for long periods of time drawing, painting and creating._

> _Max painted this and told me that I am the house and that the two trees together are him and Rachel and the tree alone is his daddy. He created this when he was 5 years old._

My son didn't speak much until he was 2 years old but he could draw and write his name. I have an early picture of his that was a blueprint of our home as disconnected pieces but it showed to me that what he knew was deeper than what he said. The painting to the left is one he made when he was in grade one. Jeff was travelling a lot for work and Max, at his young age, didn't understand why. Art was always a way that he would express his ideasâ€¦until someone told him he didn't follow the rubric. He would get frustrated and I watched him take increasingly fewer risks in his visual expression -- a means of expressing himself that had always been a solace to him.

As a principal I recall visiting a classroom where the children were asked to draw fish but the lesson was about primary colours. The success criteria indicated that the students were to paint three fish: one red, one blue and one yellow to indicate that they understood primary colours. One child drew a fish that was many colours. I was impressed at this child's ability to use colours and mix them to make a beautiful composition and the child clearly understood what colours work together without muddying them up. There was a rubric attached to each painting and this child's painting only received a C. When I asked the teacher why C she said that he didn't follow the success criteria.

Now don't get me wrong -- I don't think this is measuring creativity but I do think that many do equate art class with creativity time and yet some set such clear parameters around what success looks like that we breed compliance rather than creativity.

_If a child risks creativity and is penalized for it, how does that encourage creativity?_

_If we value creativity, should we measure it? If we measure it, do we limit it and our students?_

_If we measure what we value and value what we measure, should we then be measuring creativity?_

There are many ways to think about creativity and yet any way it is defined, it always appears as an essential skill for Modern Learners. In the Ontario context, the [Achieving Excellence: A Renewed Vision for Education in Ontario](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/about/renewedVision.pdf) (2014) mentions creativity as an essential skill that future employers are seeking.

We can think of creativity as something that happens solely within the arts.

We can think of creativity in terms of problem solving.

We can think of creativity in terms of innovation.

We can think of creativity in terms of thinking.

These ideas are not separate but rather interwoven concepts that highlight the importance of creating space for disparate ideas, tangential and integrative thinking -- these are all process based. We need to move away from false binaries into multiple ways of knowing.

I recently read an article that brought it together for me, [Using Creativity to Problem Solve](https://www.holstee.com/blogs/mindful-matter/76463237-using-creativity-to-problem-solve?utm_campaign=Using+Creativity+To+Problem-Solve+%28MM%29+%28jy3Jmw%29&utm_medium=email&_ke=ZGViZG9uc2t5QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ%3D%3D&utm_source=Master+Holstee+Newsletter+List+-+Weekly) by Pam Pech where she gives examples of the importance of creativity in problem solving -- every day problem solving as highlighted by the picture of two children finding a way to get what they want from the fridge. Pech says: _"I now consider creativity to be a voice within, an innovative idea that won't leave you alone."_

She further states:

> We each need to listen to our honorable, creative, "crazy" ideas, respect them, act on them, share them and utilize that innovation in ways that result in peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable solutions. I dare not say the survival of our world depends on it, as surviving means just getting through and settling. But rather, creativity and collaboration are required for excelling and creating sustainable solutions for all.

How do we keep that "voice within" for our learners? How do we nurture those voices rather than breed compliance and silence.

What role does assessment play in all of this?
