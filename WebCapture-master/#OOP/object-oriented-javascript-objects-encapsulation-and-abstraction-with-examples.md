Hi folks, here goes a quick post regarding the most important and frequently used concepts of advanced JavaScript... or should we say object-oriented JavaScript.

Objects are key concepts of JavaScript, so in just a bit we'll get into some code to help us better understand these concepts.

We create objects with methods, properties, and attributes. When we make them bundled inside an object it's known as _**encapsulation**. _When these methods and attributes are _**abstracted**_ from other objects, this is known as _**abstraction.**_

> _JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.

Two principles with OOP in JS are:

  * Object Creation Patter (Encapsulation)

  * Object Reuse Pattern (Inheritance)

There are many ways to create objects...

  1. Ubiquitous Object Literal

  2. Prototype Pattern

  3. Constructor Pattern

Although there are many ways to go about object creation, the best way for object creation could be a combination of the constructor and prototype patterns.

Here's an example of **encapsulation:**

...without using this keyword function and variables are private.

So conceptually we can say that, you can define and create your own objects.

There are different ways to create new objects:

  * Define and create a single object using an object literal.

  * Define and create a single object with the keyword new.

  * Define an object constructor and then create objects of the constructed type.

In ECMA5*, the `Object.create()` method creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

Stay tuned for some advanced concepts in JavaScript.
