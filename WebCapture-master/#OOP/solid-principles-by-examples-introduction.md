SOLID is a common acronym in the software development world. It's useful to remeber five best practices to design classes in a object oriented language. It means:

**Initial**

**Stands for**

**Concept**

SRP
Single Responsability Principle
A class should have only a single responsability.

OCP
Open Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

LSP
Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of theri subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

ISP
Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose-interface.

DIP
Dependency Injection Principle

One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

These concepts are easy to understand when we read them, but what does it mean to apply them in our daily coding activities? What do we have to do?

In the next posts we'll go through each concept with coding examples because as someone much smarter than me said:
