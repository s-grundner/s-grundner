This is the first post in the series of posts about the basics of psychology, that people must know to create great products. These posts will essentially be helpful for people who are/want to be products owners, entrepreneurs, marketeers and, anyone and everyone who wants to create exceptional, engaging products.

In this post I will cover _mental and conceptual models _which is the bridge between psychology and product design.

What are these and why do we even need to know about these before creating products ?

#### Mental Models

A_ mental model_ is the representation that a person has in his mind about the object he is interacting with. It is the way the person thinks about what it is they are doing.

For example, when getting a book out of the library, they form a mental model of the things they have to do to achieve this.

Important thing to note here is that not all the people have same mental models. It depends on a lot of factors like :

  1. Past experiences
  2. Intuitive perceptions
  3. Incomplete informations as well

Mental models shape the actions of how people will act or behave in a particular situation, what thing people will pay attention to and how people will approach and solve problems.

You must have figured out by now; _its the mental models that shape how people will interact with your product, and thus user research of your target audience is really important before designing your product._

#### Conceptual Model

A _conceptual model _is the actual model that is given to the person through the design and interface of the actual product. The screen, the buttons, the interface is the conceptual model. You are interacting with the product via its conceptual model.

For example a conceptual model for an online library is the interface the person interacts with as a represented concept of a library.

#### Why should you care about the mental and the conceptual models ?

Think about the facebook _like_ feature and the google plus _circles_. What is the difference between the two?

Well clearly one worked exceptionally well and the other one failed miserably. Why ?

When we see anything online, a nature tendency is to like/dislike it. Its how our brains are wired. Facebook used this mental model and replicated it on the posts with a _like _button. It is so perfectly coherent with the users mental model that liking a post or a picture seems so intuitive that it takes minimal or zero cognitive load. Thus making _like_ facebook's one of the its most used features.

Whats wrong with the google plus circles feature ?

One of the major problem that fb was facing at that time was privacy and content visibility issue with people. We have lots of friends but we might not want to share all our posts with everyone.

Google plus circles tried to solve this problem. What was different was the products conceptual model somehow did not align with the users mental models. Anyone can add you to their circles which doesn't happen in real life. It was somewhat weird getting a notification that someone added you to their circle.

The problem was there but it was not solved in the way which was intuitive to the user. Thus G+ was hard to learn, hard to use, and thus finally was not accepted.

So what do we observe here ? When we create products in which the target audience mental models are completely coherent with the products conceptual models (user interface), what is created is an engaging, easy to use product. _The products created keeping mental and conceptual model coherence in mind provide , what we call, an Intuitive user experience._

This means a minimal user cognitive load. Users don't have to put a strain on their mind to understand the product and navigation. They just start using the product effortlessly.

#### What if your product is completely new ?

Mental models are created from past experiences and what if users have NOT experienced anything close to what you are creating ? A good question.

How do we make a kid learn how to use a pencil ? We train him. We tell him how it is to be used, we show him by demonstrating how to use it, we also tell him its properties like whatever he writes with a pencil can be erased which is not the case when he writes with a pen.

So, similar thing goes for your product. A user who doesn't know anything about your completely new product, needs to be trained. There has to be proper training, demos, in short handholding the user till he learns.

We have to make sure that the experience should not become annoying and irritating. We have to properly form users mental models so that when they finally start using the product, they do it effortlessly. The functionality and usage should come intuitively to them.

So that is all about mental and conceptual models. If you have any questions do mention in the comments section below.

Will soon be writing another medium post in the series about other psychological paradigms that you guys must know to build a great product.
