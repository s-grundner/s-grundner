The essential elements of Vygotsky's sociocultural perspective include a strong Marxist influence, a theory of psychological tools, memory aids, speech, play, and ideas about schooling. The Marxist influence involves an emphasis on the fundamentally important role of social relations in development. Vygotsky's theory of psychological tools derives from Engel's work on tool use, and expands on the importance of memory aids and speech as tools. These are essentially ways of internalizing social interactions. Vygotsky's view on play is that it is far more structured and rule based than otherwise thought, and is a prototype for later taking pleasure in following one's guiding idea or moral principle. Finally, his ideas about schooling include the idea of the creation of an inter-mental space created between the teacher and student via language, and also the well-known concept of zone of proximal development, a stage of learning that is neither too challenging nor too easy for a child at any given point in their learning process.
