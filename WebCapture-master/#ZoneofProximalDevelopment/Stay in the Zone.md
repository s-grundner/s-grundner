#### Getting comfortable with discomfort

There is a certain discomfort or struggle that we have with learning. This is especially true with adults. When we're younger, we're more willing to dive head first into challenges and are less worried about the consequences. As we get older we are more hesitant to take risks and because of this, we shy away from trying new things. This is harmful not only to ones career, but also ones well-being because I do believe that a willingness to learn and true curiosity is key to lifelong happiness.

I want to introduce you all to my friend, the [Zone of Proximal Development](http://www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html) (ZPD). It's a jargony education term that has been defined as "the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers".

In other words, its the place of real struggle or discomfort between what you know and what you don't know. A place you should become very comfortable with. No one knows everything and no one knows nothing. There is always a point where you are starting and a point of expertise. Your journey on the way to the point of expertise is through the ZPD.

But more important than knowing and understanding the education term, is knowing the feeling it gives you. I love the struggle feeling between what you know and what you don't know. I feel very comfortable in the unknown and I love the experience of failure. Actually failure sucks, but learning from failure is awesome.

It's what I experience all the time when I practice calligraphy. It's what my friend experiences when he picks up the guitar, which is still fairly new to him. It's what people at work experience when they're stretched to their limits and choose to keep going.

Eventually we learn that there are no limits to learning. Through this discovery true growth can happen and the endless joy of the struggle will set in.

Struggle On!

In Life and Learning,
