Scrum and Kanban are undoubtedly the practical guides to doing agile. The popularity they have garnered over the last few decades has been overwhelming. Many agile practitioners prefer Scrum, Kanban and even newer methodologies like "Scrum-Ban"; the debate continues on which one you should choose. Let us try to unravel the key similarities and differences and their relevance in today's software realm.

## A Brief History of Scrum and Kanban

Have you seen a storekeeper stocking his supermarket shelf? When he observes that the shelf is near empty, he refills goods from the warehouse. The storekeeper never had a huge stock in his warehouse; he simply replenishes them when they near depletion. In effect, inventory levels are decided based on consumption pattern. In 1950s, engineers at Toyota were inspired by this model and adopted this in their factory floors. This practice smoothened their inventory levels and eliminated waste significantly. This system later came to be known as Kanban. Kanban simply enforces a strict work-in-progress limit and provides a visual understanding of progress of task_._

While Toyota engineers were busy adopting Kanban, American professors Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, in their HBR article "The New New Product Development Game," described speed and flexibility as essential to excel in a competitive market . They draw parallels with the game of rugby to explain the Scrum way of working. This article paved the way for iterative product development and eventually the formation of Scrum principles.

## Planning and Estimation

Planning prior is a key attribute of Scrum, and therefore estimation is essential in Scrum. Every team in Scrum works with a finite sprint capacity and plans to complete a sizeable amount of story points in the set time. In the initial sprints, estimation might be tough to arrive at, but as sprints progress, teams evolve to understand estimation accurately.

In Kanban, there are no predefined methods for estimation or planning. Team members simply pull tasks when they are available and work on it based on urgency. Unlike Scrum there are no time-boxes or sprints; delivery is continuous here.

If you are bent on getting tasks done, then Kanban is the obvious choice. If you want to work at a constant velocity, then go for Scrum.

## Work in Progress

Limiting work-in-progress is integral to Kanban. In fact, thr Kanban board is at the heart of visualizing flow of work. Mature Kanban teams tend to have a strict WIP limit for each state. Kanban minimizes work in progress at each state and moves them quickly to done state. The teams can minimize the time an item travels through system and thereby reduce the cycle time.

Like Kanban, Scrum also limits work-in-progress by using time-boxed iterations called sprints W ithin these sprints; teams complete the most valuable items. Scrum is not as strict as Kanban in imposing WIP limit. In fact, the number of stories planned for the sprint actually limits WIP. Both Scrum and Kanban try to create smaller batches of working product, but Kanban uses WIP limits more effectively.

## Team Structure and Ceremonies

Primary roles in Scrum team include the Product Owner, Scrum Master and the development team. Scrum also mandates a cross-functional team. Typical Scrum ceremonies include sprint planning to plan forthcoming sprint, sprint demos to show off key shipment, and sprint retros to understand how the iteration had gone.

Unlike the prescriptive nature of Scrum with elaborate structure and ceremonies, Kanban has no pre-defined team structure and ceremonies. Kanban actually can co-exist with any team structure as it is based on a pull mechanism. Team members allocate or pull work based on their availability. Indeed, Kanban requires greater discipline as the framework itself has minimum strings attached.

## How to Scale with Scrum or Kanban

Scaling intends to encompass a large part of your enterprise to follow single or mix of agile methodologies. Enterprise Agile Frameworks have become popular in recent times. Pure Scrum or Kanban based scaling frameworks are hard to come by, exception being Nexus and LeSS. Nexus and LeSS are mature and completely based on Scrum. Most scaling frameworks prescribe a mix of Scrum and Kanban. The largely popular SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) emphasizes on Development in Cadence (Scrum) and Release on Demand (Kanban).

## When to Use Scrum or Kanban

Kanban is suitable where there is continuous workflow such as maintenance and support tasks. These tasks need rigorous WIP limit. Kanban also exposes bottlenecks. You can see that happening when your to-do tasks pile-up at bottleneck step. As a result, Kanban processes are well-suited for business-as-usual or time critical missions.

Unlike Kanban, Scrum has its origin in software world. Scrum is focused on releasing a working product in pre-defined sprints. Its use is highly recommended in iterative product development and in some cases where multiple stakeholders are involved. Stakeholders provide valuable feedback and these are usually prioritized in upcoming sprints.
