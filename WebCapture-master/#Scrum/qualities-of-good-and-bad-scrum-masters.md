A Scrum Master is one of the three key roles of the Scrum framework. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland created the Scrum Framework back in 1986, primarily for product development. With 21 years having passed, you'd think organizations would better understand qualities of a good Scrum Master. More noteworthy, they should know qualities of a bad Scrum Master.

Because of this, I created [a simple infographic](http://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/10-scrummaster-qualities.pdf) to focus on both good and bad qualities of Scrum Masters. I've noticed, as organizations begin to scale, roles and responsibilities begin to blur. People may be asked to take on Scrum Master responsibilities. Do you have the right qualities?

## 5 Qualities of a Good Scrum Master

The Scrum Master should be an empathetic listener and healer. This self-aware steward is committed to the growth of people.

The Scrum Master can coach the other team members on how to use Scrum in the most effective manner.

### **3\. Framework Champion **

The Scrum Master is an expert on how Scrum works and how to apply it.

### 4\. **Problem Solver**

The Scrum Master protects the team from organizational disruptions or internal distractions or helps remove them.

### 5\. **Facilitator**

The Scrum Master is a neutral participant who helps a group of people understand their common objectives and assists them to achieve these objectives.

## **5 Qualities of a Bad Scrum Master**

### **1\. Boss**

The Scrum Master should not have the ability to hire and fire others.

### **2\. Taskmaster**

The bad Scrum Master myopically focuses on assigning and tracking progress against tasks.

### 3\. **Product Manager**

The Product Manager, not the Scrum Master, is responsible for managing schedule, budget, and scope of the product.

If you are apathetic, you lack interest in or concern about emotional, social, or spiritual well-being of others.
