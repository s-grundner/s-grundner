# Scrum Of Scrums

_Captured: 2015-11-22 at 17:24 from [guide.agilealliance.org](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html)_

Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrum (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a "meta Scrum." The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the Sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com) delivers to production 220 times per two week sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work.

So the Scrum of Scrums is a operational delivery mechanism.

Different trainers have different ideas about a "meta Scrum." I implemented it at PatientKeeper as the group that decides to commission sprints. Therefore the Chief Product Owner presents to the stakeholders with POs and SMs present the plan and the stakeholders recommit to the plan regularly.

For early stage companies like PatientKeeper was in the early days or like Prognosis (one of over 30 OpenView Venture Partners company's) we want everyone there that is needed to make a decision on funding, resourcing, or any change in direction. All product decisions are made there. Ben Clay describes how it was sent up at Prognosis in some detail in the Scrum Alliance LinkedIn Group.

So the meta-Scrum is a funding mechanism.

_the Scrum of Scrums is first described (summarizing experiences at IDX) in an article by Jeff Sutherland, [Agile Can Scale: Inventing and Reinventing SCRUM in Five Companies](http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/447037/6486358/1270929593650/Sutherland+200111+proof.pdf?token=tSLYm3L6HO4iGiMC2rPWIrykwl8%3D)_
