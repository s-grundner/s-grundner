Building a new product or feature isn't an easy task, and having it succeed in a marketplace is even more of a challenge. Good products captivate a target audience by addressing customer needs, while simultaneously creating a business value that differentiates it from competitors. Scrum teams conduct extensive research into consumer behaviors to build these types of ideal features. However, months of hard work developing a product can be wiped out the moment customers leave bad reviews on your offer.

Being proactive in your approach to product development is a great way to avoid this setback. Good products fulfill the needs of the consumer, so it's important to dedicate an employee to represent the voice of your customer. Hiring a Scrum product owner is a great way to create this focus on solving for the customer during the development process.

## Scrum Product Owner

The Scrum product owner is the leader in charge of creating the concept for a new product or feature. Using marketplace data and customer feedback, they guide product management teams throughout the development stages. Scrum product owners ensure that the result of a project achieves the goal outlined in the original design.

If you're unfamiliar with the Agile approach to software creation, Scrum is a product development method that considers input from every business stakeholder. Scrum teams are the engineers and developers who come together to agree on goals for a 30-day project, or "sprint." They then work together with the [product manager](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/technical-product-manager) and product owner to produce the product at the designated deadline. Scrum product owners play a crucial role in this process as they guide the vision of product from start to finish.

### Role Description

#### Product Visionary

The Scrum product owner develops the product's technical and conceptual layout. They come up with the idea of what to build, then communicate that blueprint to the product development teams. The product owner is then responsible for maximizing the value of the product or feature during the development process. Product owners do this by brainstorming new features, promoting [team collaboration](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/team-collaboration), and prioritizing customer feedback.

#### Marketplace Expertise

Scrum product owners demonstrate an expert-level understanding of the company's products as well as their target audience. They focus on creating [customer-centric](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-centric) features and are motivated by their [customers' success](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-success). It's their job to understand the needs, roadblocks, and reactions that customers experience when interacting with their company.

Additionally, Scrum product owners must possess a deep understanding of the company's product management system. It's vital that they recognize the capabilities of their development teams so that they can set ambitious, but realistic goals. Without this area of expertise, product owners may become overbearing or push their engineering and design teams past their bandwidth.

### Why You Need a Scrum Product Owner

#### Voice of the Customer

Scrum product owners are an essential position on Scrum teams because they act as the [voice of the customer](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/voice-of-the-customer). It's their job to consider the [customer's needs](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-needs) and communicate those core values to product management team members. Product owners are constantly gathering [customer reviews](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/get-customer-reviews) then filtering that feedback into the development process. By doing so, designers and engineers can create better products that exceed customer expectations.

During product development, Scrum product owners also act as a level of quality control. They make sure that the finished result matches the original intent of the product. If the project seems to be going off track, the product owner can reprioritize team efforts to meet their initial goals. When the development is completed, the product owner has the final authorization to ensure the product or feature fulfills its intent.

When creating a new product, there sometimes can be confusion over how to guide the development process. Scrum product owners lead the project by organizing engineering teams and creating long-term goals that employees can work towards. They motivate product management by including [quick ](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/quick-team-building-activities)[team-building](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/quick-team-building-activities)[ activities](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/quick-team-building-activities) that encourage teams to meet deadlines. By creating this system of open communication, teams can share information quickly to make the development process more efficient.

### Job Responsibilities

To create products that meet [customer needs](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-needs), Scrum product owners record customer roadblocks and search for their solutions. They do this by creating and maintaining a product backlog that's shared with product management. If developers have questions about the product backlog, the product owner is responsible for clarifying those details to their teammates.

## Product Backlog

A product backlog is a detailed list of potential products or features that solve problems reported by customers. It's created by the Scrum product owner who looks for trends in customer feedback then records solutions to these roadblocks in the product backlog. The product owner then prioritizes the ideas on this list and shares them with engineering and design teams to begin development.

When updating the product backlog, the Scrum product owner studies the new trends arising with the target audience and their marketplace. They conduct studies like [consumer behavior analyses](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-behavior-analysis) and research user preferences in the product usage reports. These quantitative reports help product owners confirm the patterns they're observing when studying customer stories. If trends can be statistically confirmed, Scrum product owners can be more confident in their proposed ideas.

#### Motivate Product Development

After providing the concept, the product owner has to make sure the goals are attainable for the development teams. Successful product owners can motivate product management by creating ambitious goals that team members can strive towards. Once the goal is set, it's their job to keep team members dedicated to meeting that benchmark. Scrum product owners do this by conducting sprint preparation meetings and daily stand-ups which keep teams focused on their progression.

### Scrum Product Owner Skills and Traits

While the product owner may be the leader of the project, the best owners are motivated by their team's success. Even though they come up with the overall design, product owners need to be flexible in sharing their ideas and encourage teammates to look for improvements. Good product owners don't micromanage their teams; instead, they challenge their employees to optimize the product. This keeps employees actively engaged because they feel more invested in the product's success.

#### Effective Communicator

The Scrum product owner's job is to translate customer needs into a product that development teams can produce. This requires product owners to be excellent [team communicators](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/team-communication) because their product's vision must be clear to all company stakeholders. They also provide tough criticisms to hard-working engineers who they're relying on for meeting deadlines. Product owners perform this balancing act continuously throughout the development process to appease stakeholder interests.

For a product to be successful in its marketplace, it has to be unique from its competitors. To create a product that stands out from the rest, Scrum product owners must possess a thorough understanding of the customer as well as their market. Successful product owners do this by being [customer-focused](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-focus) which places the customer's success at the forefront of their decision-making process.

### Who Product Owners Work With

Scrum product owners work with marketing, sales, and customer service teams to obtain a complete view of the customer's experience. Marketing teams have useful consumer reports and updated information on marketplace trends that outline customer buying behaviors. Sales teams work directly with customers and can share information on specific roadblocks that are frustrating potential leads. Finally, [customer support](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-support) teams provide first-person insight into the user's experience with the product.

#### Upper Management

As the leader of the project, the product owner acts as the liaison between the product management teams and upper management. They provide managers with updates on their progress and explain any changes being made to the development process. They also communicate projected deadlines as well as their expectations for when the product will be completed.

#### External Stakeholders

While the customer's success is the primary focus, Scrum product owners must consider the needs of all their external stakeholders. This includes stakeholders who are financially invested in the company and are concerned with the business value of the product. To appease these groups, product owners use [first-party data](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/first-party-data) to demonstrate the potential benefits of their new product or feature.
