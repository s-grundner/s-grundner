There are certainly many misconceptions that occur with having to implement agility within the organization. The issue becomes even more compounded when non-agile practitioners speculate about what Agile is or for that matter what their idea of what it should be. In our example, this kind of speculation can present a sort of revolving door phenomenon whereby those who are familiar with Scrum, use it to refer to Agile interchangeably. Admittedly, Scrum is a large part of Agile when referring to it holistically, but Agile is not Scrum. However, we can derive some values from Scrum and say that they are synonymous with [Agile values](http://theagiletimes.com/7-virtues-of-an-agile-mindset/). What tends to happen is that many people believe that if they are doing Scrum, then automatically they are Agile. There's a very fine line to that supposition, but it's not always entirely true.

## Part Of The Whole Doesn't Necessarily Mean You Are All Of The Whole

For the most part, implementing a part of the whole doesn't necessarily mean you are all of the whole. As an example we can use the idea of electricity. If some parts of a car (i.e. radio, window system, pumps, battery) are electric, would you say that your car is an "electric" car? Not likely. Even when we do refer to electric cars that are motorized by electric power cells alone, the car isn't entirely electric per se. This comparison although not an exact representation of the differences in Agile or Scrum, hopefully can give you the level of complexity in the assumption of either one for another.

## Agile Is Not Just A Process

For further clarity, there are other mechanisms of Agile in perspective, there is also a mindset and value-driven aspects that should be accompanied with it, not just a process. There's also other methodologies and processes that can be included or can be complimentary to Scrum (i.e. XP, Kanban, TDD, ATDD) that make a more solid [Agile implementation](http://theagiletimes.com/automation-key-agile-implementation/) possible. That is not to say that it's an "all-or-nothing" situation. Further to this we have what is considered to be the Agile guidelines, also known as the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) consisting of 4 values and 12 principles. When speculation and discussion occurs about what Agile really is, very seldom does the conversation include what is mentioned in the manifesto. However, more often, the concept of implementing a Scrum process does. This is where the clarification about those assumptions or beliefs, is very important to distinguish before it's too late, whereby the decision takes place and is built on a preconceived false notion of Agile.

## Agile Expectation And Implementation

Getting the above points out in the open early is not only to assure successful Agile expectation and implementation, but also to bring a more positive light to what can sometimes bring "failures-as-fact." By that we mean that there are many who have attempted implementing Agile in the workplace, and used a "not-so-complete" method or process into effect. That is to say, they thought they were putting an Agile methodology (or in certain cases what they thought was Agile) in place, then saw it fail, and then concluded "Agile doesn't work" despite the other flaws. There are certainly instances where Agile really doesn't work, or perhaps it isn't the best solution for your organization, politics and bureaucracy aside. Agile isn't the cure-all solution to all your organizational woes but can definitely be more fun! Even when it's not a good match for the organization, not implementing Agile is perfectly fine, it's not a must, and further to that, it's not a religion (although it sometimes is perceived as such).
