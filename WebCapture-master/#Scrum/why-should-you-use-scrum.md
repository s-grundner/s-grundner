SCRUM is the next big thing in the field of project delivery and is also one of the most popular #Agile methodologies. Let us begin by asking this question "Why do I need #Scrum?"

Well, Scrum as a methodology is a good way to manage projects across various industries. Not only is it fast, adaptive, iterative and flexible but it also ensures transparency in communications and creates an environment of collective accountability and continuous progress. To elaborate the above mentioned points, let us have a look at some of the key benefits one can reap by using Scrum methodology to deliver projects.

"**Adaptability_"_**is the very first benefit I want to point out here. The Scrum principles of _Empirical process control_ and _iterative delivery_ make projects adaptable and open to incorporating change when it occurs. Scrum processes are designed to embrace change. Thus Scrum methodology is best suited to deliver projects in a chaotic and ever changing environment.

A key benefit for stakeholders is that Scrum is **_"Customer Centric"_**. Emphasis on _business value_ and having a _collaborative approach_ that includes stakeholders ensures a customer-oriented framework in a Scrum controlled project.

**_"Continuous Delivery of Value" _**is an additional benefit that results from being customer centric. In Scrum, iterative processes enable the continuous delivery of value through the _Ship Deliverables _process. Each Sprint produces a potentially shippable product, service, or desired result.

**_"Early Delivery of High Value"_** is a closely related business benefit of using Scrum. Not only is the delivery of value continuous, the _Create Prioritized Product Backlog _process ensures that the highest value requirements of the customer are met first.

Both the customer and the project team benefit from "**_Continuous Feedback._**" In Scrum, continuous feedback is provided through the _Conduct Daily Standup_ and _Demonstrate and Validate Sprint _processes.

Continuous feedback contributes to another key benefit, **"Transparency"**. In a Scrum managed project, all information centers such as the _Scrumboard_ and _Sprint Burndown Chart_ are continually displayed and updated, which leads to an open working environment. Sprint Review Meetings demonstrate potentially shippable products to stakeholders, keeping them always informed about the current status and progress of the project.

Transparency leads to another important benefit **_"High Trust Environment"_**. The _Conduct Daily Standup _and _Retrospect Sprint _processes promote transparency and collaboration. This leads to a high-trust work environment ensuring low friction between employees.

Scrum's adaptability and transparency create an environment of **_"Continuous Improvement." _**As the project progresses, the deliverables are improved progressively _Sprint by Sprint_, with changes and improvements being included and managed through the _Groom Prioritized Product Backlog _process.

Another important benefit is **_"Sustainable Pace._**" Scrum processes are designed such that the people involved can work at a pace that they can sustain indefinitely.

Another benefit of using Scrum is **_"Efficient Development Process._**" In Scrum, it has been observed that time-boxing and minimizing non-essential work leads to higher efficiency levels.

The next benefit is **_"Motivation"_**. The _Conduct Daily Standup _and _Retrospect Sprint _processes lead to greater levels of motivation among employees.

**_"Faster Problem Resolution" _**is another of the important benefits of using Scrum in projects. _Collaboration _and _colocation of cross-functional teams _lead to identifying and solving problems more quickly.

The next benefit is _"**Effective Deliverables**"_. The _Demonstrate and Validate Sprint _process and regular reviews after creation of deliverables ensures delivery of effective outputs to the customer.

The next benefit is **_"Collective Environment"_**. The _Approve, Estimate_, _and Commit User Stories _process allows team members to take ownership of the project and of their work leading to better quality in Scrum.

**_"High Velocity"_** is another important benefit. A collaborative framework enables highly skilled _cross-functional teams_ to achieve their full potential and high velocity. Some of signatories to the _Agile Manifesto _call this state "hyper-productivity."

And the last benefit that we will discuss is Scrum's **_"Innovative Environment"_**. The _Retrospect Sprint _and _Retrospect Project _processes create an environment of introspection, learning, and adaptability leading to an innovative and creative work environment.
