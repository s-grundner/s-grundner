[Daily Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(development\)#Daily_Scrum) is about a group of humans working out how they will collaborate for a day. It isn't a status reporting meeting. It's not for management. It can't be replaced by electronic status reports. Tools like iDoneThis and the deceased TweetScrum remove the human interaction which is the entire point of the event. If you don't talk to your peers either Face to Face, Video conference or, at worst, over the phone, then your Daily Scrum is missing most of its value. If your Daily Scrum has become boring, don't make it electronic, don't make it Monday, Wednesday, Friday - diagnose the problem. See: [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) and [Pathologies of the Daily Scrum](http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2010/04/pathologies-of-the-daily-scrum-or-standup.html).

As recovering Software Developers we all love our tools, however we need to remember: "**Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools", Daily Scrum should be about the former and not the latter.
