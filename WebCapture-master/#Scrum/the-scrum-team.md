The Scrum Team consists of a [Product Owner](https://scrummastertest.com/scrum-product-owner-5fbe63273671#.ok45xotzj), the [Development Team](https://scrummastertest.com/scrum-development-team-37183a261a74#.ionm5d3l6), and a [Scrum Master](https://scrummastertest.com/the-scrum-master-7bc4aecb09b3#.pf733rbne). Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

**Accountability**  
The Scrum Team as a whole is responsible to deliver the committed delivery in time and with the defined quality. A good result or a failure is never attributed to a single team member but always the result of the Scrum Team.
