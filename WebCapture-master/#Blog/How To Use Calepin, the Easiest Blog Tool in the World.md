I just fell in love with [Calepin](http://calepin.co). It's a blogging tool that gives you an instant, minimal website using two of geeks' favorite little helpers: [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is nerdy, but only a little bit, and I'll talk you through the whole thing. By the end of this short tutorial, I bet you'll want one.

First, you need an account. Go to [Calepin.co](http://calepin.co) and register your user name. It's early; you can probably get whatever you want. Next, log in with [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). Calepin will create a folder in your Dropbox that it will watch for text files written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). When you click the big 'Publish' button on the Calepin site, it will publish all the documents as a blog at [user name].calepin.co. Here's [mine, for example](http://jonm.calepin.co). The blog's appearance is spare and relaxing. It's a great place to just stick your thoughts up on the Web. Don't know what a Dropbox or a Markdown is? Don't worry. You'll quickly get the gist.

**What The Heck's A Dropbox?**

If you don't have a Dropbox account, you'll want one. Think of Dropbox as a folder on your computer that syncs to the cloud. Our editor-in-chief, Richard MacManus, just wrote a great [tutorial about cloud storage services](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_store_your_files_in_the_cloud.php) that will teach you all the reasons you'd want Dropbox or something like it.

As you'll see in that post, there are several choices, but I recommend Dropbox, especially if you want to use Calepin. You can use [Dropbox.com](http://readwrite.com/http//dropbox.com) to manage it from the Web, but it's also a free desktop application that lets you treat it just like a normal folder on your computer that syncs automatically. You get 2GB of space for free, and that's _plenty_ for a blog.

Ready to sign up now? I _did_ refer you, so you could _consider_ signing up through my [referral link](http://db.tt/BiZfHbp) (winky face), so I can get a little more space in mine. If you don't want to indulge me, just go to [Dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com) to sign up.

**Markdown? That sounds scary.**

I promise [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) isn't scary. It's an easy, human-readable way to format text for the Web. [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net)'s John Gruber invented it. For our purposes here, all you need to know about it is that it's much cleaner and easier than HTML. But it's important to know that **Markdown understands HTML**. If you forget how to do something in Markdown, you can always do it the old-fashioned HTML way. Here's an example of what Markdown looks like:

To write:

> `**Hello, there!** This is an introduction to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It's _really_ easy to use, and I promise you'll _**LOVE**_ it!`

This is all you need:

> `**Hello, there!** This is an introduction to [Markdown][1]. It's *really* easy to use, and I promise you'll ***LOVE*** it!  
  
[1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/`

Isn't that nice and easy to read? It's also really powerful; you can do pretty much anything you'd need HTML to do, and Calepin will turn it into Web-ready HTML without you having to worry about it. You can learn everything you need to know in [Daring Fireball's Markdown tutorial](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I write all my RWW posts in Markdown, and I write faster, less stressfully and with fewer errors than I ever had in HTML before.

**Now Put Them All Together!**

To post to your Calepin blog, you just write up your post using any plain text editor you want and **save it as a .md file** in the Calepin folder in your Dropbox. Want to use images? No problem. You can at least insert an [image using Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img), or you can just use HTML if you need more control over it. You can host the image on a free service like [Imgur](http://imgur.com), or you can even put it in your Dropbox public folder. Either way, just grab the URL and put it in your blog post. Then log in to [Calepin.co](http://calepin.co) and click the big 'Publish' button, and your posts will go right up on the Web.

That's it! You've got a blog. Mine's [jonm.calepin.co](http://jonm.calepin.co). What's yours?

Calepin is powered by [Pelican](http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/2.7.2/index.html), an anagram of "Calepin" that is also an open-source weblog generator written in Python. If you're interested, you can view or fork the source code [on Github](http://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/). Future features include a few themes, as well as respect for a /theme folder for your own, and custom domains.

Oceans of thanks to [Merlin Mann](http://merlinmann.com), the Internet wizard who turned me onto [Calepin](http://calepin.co). He recently made fun of me on [this podcast](http://5by5.tv/b2w/40). [Back To Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) is a show that will teach you about writing, the Internet and getting better at stuff. I listen every week, and you should too.
