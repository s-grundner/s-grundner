> _Can you name a Design Pattern?_

A Design Pattern? You mean from the '90s?

> _Yes, they were made popular in 1995. Though they are much older than that._

There was a book wasn't there?

> _Yes, it was named Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software._

Written by four guys.

> _Correct, "The Gang of Four": Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.[1]_

It's kind of old and out of date now, isn't it?

> _What makes you say that?_

Well, there are newer books.

> _Indeed there are many newer books on the topic, and some are quite good; but none are quite so impactful and insightful as the original._

Anyway, the whole idea is old and broken.

> _Broken?_

Yeah, like, I've heard people say that Design Patterns were invented to fix some problems in Object-Oriented Programming.

> _Some problems? What problems?_

I dunno. That's just what I've heard. Like, Design Patterns were really just workarounds for bad languages.

> _Bad Languages? Like what?_

I Dunno -- like, maybe C++ and Java. You know. Static languages.

> _What a strange thing to say. Smalltalk, a dynamic language, played a significant role._

Well, and anyway, they don't really apply to the future, with Functional Programming and all?

> _My Goodness! What Nonsense!_

Well, that's just what I've heard.

> _I think you've been listening to the wrong people._

It was just twitter and facebook and stuff.

> _Ah, I see. Social Networks: The font of all wisdom and knowledge._

Yeah, OK, I get your point.

> _I hope so; but just in case let me be perfectly clear..._

That's what politicians say when they're about to lie to you.

> _... (sigh)...Listen ... Carefully. The Design Patterns book is one of the most important books, if not THE most important book, written about software within the last 20 years._

Oh, come on now. It's twenty years old. I mean maybe it was great way back in the nineteen hundreds; but this is like the twenty-first century. We've got Ruby. We've got Clojure. We've got Node, and Angular, and Rails and IOS and Mobile and ... I mean ... Software's changed a lot! We've outgrown all that old stuff.

> _You think software has changed in the last 20 years?_

Well, of course! I mean... Duh.

> _You have much to learn about what the word "Change" means. In fact, the fundamentals of software have changed very little in the last four decades._

How can you say that? I mean, look at all this new stuff!

> _You mean the glitter?_

Glitter!! Are you calling Rails, and Angular, and Node and... Glitter?

> _Yes. Glitter. It sparkles for awhile but it doesn't last. There's always more glitter to follow._

But there are some really great ideas in those frameworks. How can you call that glitter?

> _The ideas aren't glitter. The frameworks are. Most of the ideas in those frameworks are old. They've been around for decades. The ideas are ... Design Patterns._

Wait. Are you saying that Active Record is a Design Pattern?

> _Of course it is. Or rather there are several Design Patterns within Active Record. Active Record is a unique combination of many very old, tried and true, patterns of software design._

OK, now hold on. Just what _is_ a design pattern?

> _A Design Pattern is a named canonical form for a combination of software structures and procedures that have proven to be useful over the years._

Named? Canonical? Huh?

> _Yes, every Design Pattern has a name and a canonical form. Professional software designers use those names and forms to communicate with each other. When they see the name of a pattern in software, or if they recognize the form, then they immediately know the designer's intent._

Can you give me an example?

> _Sure, here are two that are not from the Design Patterns book. Model-View-Controller and Dependency-Injection._

Those are Design Patterns?

> _Of course. They have a well-recognized name, and they have a canonical form._

I get the name part; but what's the form?

> _Well, take MVC. You'd expect there to be three objects, a model object, a controller object, and a view object. The Model handles the business rules. The Controller handles input. The View handles output._

And I put the models, views, and controllers in different directories.

> _Uh, well, Yes! In certain frameworks that has become part of the canonical form._

What do you mean in _certain_ frameworks.

> _Just that in the original specification of MVC, directories weren't mentioned. Indeed, the original form of MVC is considerably more involved than what I just described; but that's a story for a different time._

You mean there's more to MVC than just three directories and three types of objects?

> _(chuckle) Oh, yes. Much, much, more. But that's for later._

OK, so I'm starting to get the idea. If I say "Dependency Injection", everybody knows exactly what I mean. So I don't have to explain myself.

> _Right. It saves a lot of time when designers all know the Design Patterns. They can just talk to each other using those names._

OK, and if follow the form of the pattern, then everybody will know what to expect in the code.

> _Right! By following the canonical form, you relieve everyone else of the work of having to decode what you have done. They recognize the form and can follow it easily._

And you say there are a lot of these patterns?

> _The Design Patterns book gives names and forms to twenty-three tried and true solutions to common software problems._

Hmmm. And they're all as useful as MVC and DI?

> _Some are much more useful than that!_

Hmmm. I should probably learn them then.

> _I would say so! Can you name one now?_

Uh...

> _Just one._

Uh...

> _Let me help you: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton, Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor._

I think I've got some studying to do.

> _Yes, I think you do._
