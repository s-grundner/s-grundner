In handling large-scale JavaScript applications, we need to manage the code accordingly. While devising the architecture for your large-scale application, it's important to think ahead. You can also break down your application's functionality into blocks or modules by using any of the patterns.

### **What Is a Pattern?**

A pattern is a kind of reusable solution that can be applied to a commonly occurring problem in your application during the design phase. In this article, I will be considering only JavaScript applications.

### **Why Use Patterns in Your Applications?**

It's when you move beyond the simple and rough snippets of jQuery and start working on the more complex User Interactions that your code can become difficult to understand and to debug.

Patterns provide solid approaches to solving issues you may run into in software development.

Like we said, patterns are reusable solutions that can be adapted to suit your needs, hence they make the application more robust.

  * Reusing patterns assists in preventing the minor issues that can cause the major problems in the application development process.

  * Patterns are generalized solutions to a problem. So the generalized approach means that regardless of the application, the Desing pattern can be applied to improve the structure of your code.

  * If you are reusing the code or solution, naturally, it's going to reduce the file size.

> "The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application." \-

### **Is a Pattern a Template?**

Yes, patterns are not the exact solution to some problem. They are a template. Thus, the role of a pattern is to provide the solution scheme.

### **The Rule Of Three**

The Rule of Three stands for the requirements for a pattern to be valid. The three key areas that are referred to in the Rule of Three are:

  1. Fitness of Purpose.

  2. Usefulness.

  3. Applicability.

### **Patterns in Javascript :**

  1. Object Literal Design Pattern.

  2. Constructors With Prototypes.

  3. The Revealing Module Pattern.

  4. The Singleton Pattern.

  5. Observer Pattern.
