Eclipse is an extensible and reliable platform which has been used my thousands of developers. Learning Eclipse platform is very time-consuming, since there are so many features. One way to make it easier is understanding the architecture design. This is about deciphering eclipse platform and designs. The tutorials below use examples to illustrate how eclipse works and explain design patterns used in each layer of the architecture. After reading those short tutorials, you should be able to quickly get start started with Eclipse RCP.

Some design patterns used in eclipse is listed above but not illustrated. The reason is they are very straightforward, you can directly check out the design pattern and figure out how it is used in eclipse. It is worth to mention that reading some part of the source code is very helpful for understanding the design. One easy way to do it is downloading Eclipse Classic which includes source code.
