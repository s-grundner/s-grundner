I have intended to write a short e-book about [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) using the python programming language. This is inspired by the aptly titled [ Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_\(book\)) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides who are collectively known as the Gang of Four (GOF).

While I started to write this as an e-book, I now think the way to do this is write a blog post per design pattern and then compile them into a guide which I will keep here. This is much in the same way that Rafe Kettler wrote his guide to pythons magic methods which can be found [here](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html).

Why do I want to do this? I want to write this to pass on some knowledge which I have gained working as a software engineer, but also to learn a lot. I think of these as the twin goals of this blog because if I write about something I want to get it right. While I know quite a bit about some design patterns there are others I definitely don't.

Here is the list of the design patterns I hope to tackle.

  * Creational
    * Abstract Factory
    * Builder
    * Factory Method
    * Prototype
    * Singleton
  * Structural
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
  * Behavioural
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template
    * Visitor
  * UI Patterns
    * Model View Presenter (MVP)
    * Model View Controller (MVC)
    * Model View View-Model (MVVM)

The first 3 sections are directly from the GOF book and that is where I am drawing most of my inspiration from. However that book used examples from C++ and smalltalk and I believe that writing in python will simplify this hugely.

I have already started this endeavour writing in LaTex and it and my examples are already on my gitHub account [here](https://github.com/davidcorne/Design-Patterns-In-Python).

Hopefully my first article will be along shortly. (oh and Happy New Year and thanks for reading)
