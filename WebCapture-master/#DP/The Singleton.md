# The Singleton

Possibly the simplest design pattern is the _singleton_, which is a way to provide one and only one object of a particular type. To accomplish this, you must take control of object creation out of the hands of the programmer. One convenient way to do this is to delegate to a single instance of a private nested inner class:

    
    
    # Singleton/SingletonPattern.py
    
    class OnlyOne:
        class __OnlyOne:
            def __init__(self, arg):
                self.val = arg
            def __str__(self):
                return repr(self) + self.val
        instance = None
        def __init__(self, arg):
            if not OnlyOne.instance:
                OnlyOne.instance = OnlyOne.__OnlyOne(arg)
            else:
                OnlyOne.instance.val = arg
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            return getattr(self.instance, name)
    
    x = OnlyOne('sausage')
    print(x)
    y = OnlyOne('eggs')
    print(y)
    z = OnlyOne('spam')
    print(z)
    print(x)
    print(y)
    print(`x`)
    print(`y`)
    print(`z`)
    output = '''
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0076B7AC>sausage
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0076B7AC>eggs
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0076B7AC>spam
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0076B7AC>spam
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0076B7AC>spam
    <__main__.OnlyOne instance at 0076C54C>
    <__main__.OnlyOne instance at 0076DAAC>
    <__main__.OnlyOne instance at 0076AA3C>
    '''
    

Because the inner class is named with a double underscore, it is private so the user cannot directly access it. The inner class contains all the methods that you would normally put in the class if it weren't going to be a singleton, and then it is wrapped in the outer class which controls creation by using its constructor. The first time you create an **OnlyOne**, it initializes **instance**, but after that it just ignores you.

Access comes through delegation, using the **__getattr__( )** method to redirect calls to the single instance. You can see from the output that even though it appears that multiple objects have been created, the same **__OnlyOne** object is used for both. The instances of **OnlyOne** are distinct but they all proxy to the same **__OnlyOne** object.

Note that the above approach doesn't restrict you to creating only one object. This is also a technique to create a limited pool of objects. In that situation, however, you can be confronted with the problem of sharing objects in the pool. If this is an issue, you can create a solution involving a check-out and check- in of the shared objects.

A variation on this technique uses the class method **__new__** added in Python 2.2:

    
    
    # Singleton/NewSingleton.py
    
    class OnlyOne(object):
        class __OnlyOne:
            def __init__(self):
                self.val = None
            def __str__(self):
                return `self` + self.val
        instance = None
        def __new__(cls): # __new__ always a classmethod
            if not OnlyOne.instance:
                OnlyOne.instance = OnlyOne.__OnlyOne()
            return OnlyOne.instance
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            return getattr(self.instance, name)
        def __setattr__(self, name):
            return setattr(self.instance, name)
    
    x = OnlyOne()
    x.val = 'sausage'
    print(x)
    y = OnlyOne()
    y.val = 'eggs'
    print(y)
    z = OnlyOne()
    z.val = 'spam'
    print(z)
    print(x)
    print(y)
    #<hr>
    output = '''
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0x00798900>sausage
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0x00798900>eggs
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0x00798900>spam
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0x00798900>spam
    <__main__.__OnlyOne instance at 0x00798900>spam
    '''
    

Alex Martelli makes the [observation](http://www.aleax.it/Python/5ep.html) that what we really want with a Singleton is to have a single set of state data for all objects. That is, you could create as many objects as you want and as long as they all refer to the same state information then you achieve the effect of Singleton. He accomplishes this with what he calls the _Borg_ [1], which is accomplished by setting all the **__dict__**s to the same static piece of storage:

    
    
    # Singleton/BorgSingleton.py
    # Alex Martelli's 'Borg'
    
    class Borg:
        _shared_state = {}
        def __init__(self):
            self.__dict__ = self._shared_state
    
    class Singleton(Borg):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            Borg.__init__(self)
            self.val = arg
        def __str__(self): return self.val
    
    x = Singleton('sausage')
    print(x)
    y = Singleton('eggs')
    print(y)
    z = Singleton('spam')
    print(z)
    print(x)
    print(y)
    print(`x`)
    print(`y`)
    print(`z`)
    output = '''
    sausage
    eggs
    spam
    spam
    spam
    <__main__.Singleton instance at 0079EF2C>
    <__main__.Singleton instance at 0079E10C>
    <__main__.Singleton instance at 00798F9C>
    '''
    

This has an identical effect as **SingletonPattern.py** does, but it's more elegant. In the former case, you must wire in _Singleton_ behavior to each of your classes, but _Borg_ is designed to be easily reused through inheritance.

A simpler version [2] of this takes advantage of the fact that there's only one instance of a class variable:

    
    
    # Singleton/ClassVariableSingleton.py
    class SingleTone(object):
        __instance = None
        def __new__(cls, val):
            if SingleTone.__instance is None:
                SingleTone.__instance = object.__new__(cls)
            SingleTone.__instance.val = val
            return SingleTone.__instance
    

Two other interesting ways to define singleton [3] include wrapping a class and using metaclasses. The first approach could be thought of as a _class decorator_ (decorators will be defined later in the book), because it takes the class of interest and adds functionality to it by wrapping it in another class:

    
    
    # Singleton/SingletonDecorator.py
    class SingletonDecorator:
        def __init__(self,klass):
            self.klass = klass
            self.instance = None
        def __call__(self,*args,**kwds):
            if self.instance == None:
                self.instance = self.klass(*args,**kwds)
            return self.instance
    
    class foo: pass
    foo = SingletonDecorator(foo)
    
    x=foo()
    y=foo()
    z=foo()
    x.val = 'sausage'
    y.val = 'eggs'
    z.val = 'spam'
    print(x.val)
    print(y.val)
    print(z.val)
    print(x is y is z)
    

[[ Description ]]

The second approach uses metaclasses, a topic I do not yet understand but which looks very interesting and powerful indeed (note that Python 2.2 has improved/simplified the metaclass syntax, and so this example may change):

    
    
    # Singleton/SingletonMetaClass.py
    class SingletonMetaClass(type):
        def __init__(cls,name,bases,dict):
            super(SingletonMetaClass,cls)\
              .__init__(name,bases,dict)
            original_new = cls.__new__
            def my_new(cls,*args,**kwds):
                if cls.instance == None:
                    cls.instance = \
                      original_new(cls,*args,**kwds)
                return cls.instance
            cls.instance = None
            cls.__new__ = staticmethod(my_new)
    
    class bar(object):
        __metaclass__ = SingletonMetaClass
        def __init__(self,val):
            self.val = val
        def __str__(self):
            return `self` + self.val
    
    x=bar('sausage')
    y=bar('eggs')
    z=bar('spam')
    print(x)
    print(y)
    print(z)
    print(x is y is z)

## Exercises

  1. **SingletonPattern.py** always creates an object, even if it's never used. Modify this program to use _lazy initialization_, so the singleton object is only created the first time that it is needed.
  2. Using **SingletonPattern.py** as a starting point, create a class that manages a fixed number of its own objects. Assume the objects are database connections and you only have a license to use a fixed quantity of these at any one time.
  3. Modify **BorgSingleton.py** so that it uses a class **__new__( )** method.
