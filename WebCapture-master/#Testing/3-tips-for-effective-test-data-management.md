## What Is Test Data Management?

As a tester, you may experience a problem that all the tester experiences every day: how to manage test data. Test data is the information used as the input of a test case and the static or transactional information. It is a fact that data preparing is the time-consuming and hardest phase of software testing. Test data management is a process of organizing this data to ensure that it is input correctly and the results are also reported properly. This process defines standards, tasks, ownership, roles, and responsibilities to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and integrity of test data. It also plays a critical role in ensuring that sensitive information is processed securely during the testing phase. In other words, test data management is one of the most important parts of any product's success. As the testing process can generate a huge volume of data, using test data management can reduce costly and time-consuming errors and also help testers clearly understand their jobs. Test data management activities are required for all phases and types of testing (Performance Testing, Production Verification, Regression Testing and Test Automation and so on).

## Why Manage Test Data?

Some of the key benefits of test data management that you can gain:

  * If the test data is quickly and easily available then it can reduce the life cycle time of the application. This leads to the faster route to market or provides more time for extensive testing to create better quality software.
  * Test data management helps to lower the test data creation times and reduce the execution time. Testers can focus on testing rather than test data creation. This will reduce time to market of the product.
  * The data is used for [data-driven testing](https://www.katalon.com/resources-center/tutorials/data-driven-testing/) will be more accurate and this prevents bug fixes and rollbacks. Reducing data-related to defects help to increase the efficiency of the process.
  * It is absolutely mandatory that test data don't contain data from production without being masked. If the data is not secure enough, then there is every chance that a data breach might happen, which can cause a big loss to the organization. Test data management will lower the organization's compliance and security risks.

## Test Data Management Challenges & Tips

There are 3 key challenges when it comes to effective test data management:

  1. Data validity and consistency - How old is the data? Where did it come from? Can you guarantee its integrity?
  2. Data privacy - Are you adhering to government and industry regulations? Are you safeguarding customer privacy? Are you protecting your data?
  3. Data selection and sub-setting - Can you scale down the production environment and choose a representative subset of data? Is your selection process effective?

And here are some tips to help you overcome these challenges

### Plan Carefully

Planning carefully before testing can prevent serious problems in identifying the real issues in the future. Make sure that your data selection, migration, and validation process is secure and effective. Evaluate the process and enhance it as much as possible.

### Mask Sensitive Data

No one wants the credentials or sensitive information will be leaked, so that make sure you mask all these confidential data before executing or exporting to someone.

### Maintain Data Source

In order to prevent wasting effort for obsolete, old data, we need maintain data often. Unwanted data would not only make your storage reach the limitation but also make you confused when select appropriate data to execute.
