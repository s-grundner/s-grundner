**[The State of API Integration 2018](https://dzone.com/go?i=285436&u=https%3A%2F%2Foffers.cloud-elements.com%2Fthe-state-of-api-integrations-report-2018%3Futm_source%3Ddzone%26utm_medium%3Ddisplay%26utm_content%3Dpre-roll): Get Cloud Elements' report for the most comprehensive breakdown of the API integration industry's past, present, and future.**

2018 is set to witness an era of Digital Evolution. The Software Industries are commencing on reduced time to market life cycle with the main focus on Quality Assurance and Testing. These organizations are targeting for optimum functional testing across the channels. To get this level of optimization in software testing, we have to manage issues and bugs found in software very carefully and precisely. Here comes GitHub in limelight, a very powerful tool to manage issues, bugs, and codes. It is the largest Git repository and leading development collaboration tool, which brought 24 million people from almost 200 countries together to code better, manage issues, and build bigger last year.

I have scrutinized many online software testing tools and came up with 5 such tools to integrate with GitHub. These tools are the best fit to leverage the GitHub bug management feature.

## Cross Browser Testing

This is a [tool ](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/)to test your website in dozens of browsers and real devices with instant results. Over a thousand combinations of browsers, OS's, and plugins. With the power of Cross Browser Testing and GitHub's webhooks, you can take screenshots and run automated tests across 1500+ browsers with every push.

## LambdaTest

[LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) is basically a cross-browser testing platform where you can test your website/web application across 1400+ combinations of browsers, browser versions, and operating systems.

So many times, the problem that testers might face while performing cross-browser testing is to log bugs.

They have to go through a hectic process of taking the screenshot, attaching it, entering description, work environment, etc. This is cumbersome, and everyone hates that long process. LambdaTest's integration made it easier.

If you find any issue while testing your web app on LambdaTest platform, you can mark it as an issue in your GitHub account directly from LambdaTest platform.

You just need to select Repository, Label, and assign the issue along with your comments_. _  
LambdaTest will create a new issue in your Github repository, automatically! The new issue will include the link to screenshots taken from LambdaTest along with details like testing environment such as Operating system, browser and its version, screen resolution as well as issue description.
