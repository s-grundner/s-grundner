## What Is Security Testing?

Security testing is performed to determine whether the data within an information system is protected, and the anticipated functionality is sustained. Security testing assures that the following aspects of data and information are maintained at any cost:

  1. Authentication
  2. Authorization
  3. Availability
  4. Confidentiality
  5. Integrity
  6. Non-repudiation

Security protects applications against external malware and other unanticipated threats that may result in malfunction or exploitation of the application. These unanticipated threats could be either deliberate or unplanned. **Security testing tools detect and analyze whether the third-party requests are benign or detrimental.**

Studies suggest that security should, in fact, be made a business priority, as businesses of the day are running the show predominantly through digital platforms. Organizations, therefore, need to be able to invest in security, in order to guarantee products and services of utmost quality. There are many highly effective security testing tools that would help achieve the desired security for all the systems within an organization.

Security testing is an integral part of [software testing](http://www.cigniti.com/) and essentially ascertains that systematic loopholes within an organization are little to none. The more the loopholes, the higher a loss to the organization so as to cope with the weaknesses of the system.

There are various security testing tools used as part of [security testing](http://www.cigniti.com/security-testing) methodologies. A few such methodologies are:

  1. **Tiger Box Testing**: This hacking is usually done on a laptop which has a collection of OSs and hacking tools. This testing helps penetration testers and security testers to conduct vulnerabilities assessment and attacks.
  2. **Black Box Testing**: Testers are authorized to perform testing on everything about the network topology and the technology.
  3. **Grey Box Testing**: Partial information is given to the testers about the system, and it is a hybrid of white and black box models.

The following flow highlights the corresponding security processes that need to be adopted for every phase in the software development lifecycle: ([Source](http://www.guru99.com/what-is-security-testing.html))

> _Why Security Testing?_

According to Cisco's 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report, over 33% of the organizations all over the globe had to deal with a cyber-breach in 2016. This resulted in a severe loss of users, business opportunities, and overall revenue by a whopping 20%. The report surveyed nearly 3,000 chief security officers (CSOs) and security operations leaders from 13 countries.

Security testing tools are many in number, each with the ability to focus on a certain element of the intricate interconnectedness of a software system. Security testing helps avoid:

  * Loss of customer trust.
  * Inconsistent website performance.
  * Additional costs required to repair website after an attack.
  * Other legal implications that arise due to lax security measures.

### **How Lack of Security Testing Can Impact Business.**

Digital networks are now a testament to the foremost layer of the security of a nation, whether the attack in question is cyber or physical in nature. As the number of digital invaders grows, it is undeniable that **a [security-breach](http://www.cigniti.com/blog/why-data-security-is-important-and-how-security-testing-helps/) is not a question of _if_, rather a question of _when_.** More than anything, this particular realization prompts organizations into action.

The Cisco study also found that 20% of breached organizations lost customers, with 40% of them losing more than 20% of their customer base. As many as 29 % lost revenue and 23% breached organizations lost business opportunities.
