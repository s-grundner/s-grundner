> _Application level performance testing_

In an economy where applications have become the heart of almost every business, you get less than one second to impress your user. In this limited time, you can only impress your user by ensuring efficient application performance and providing quality of your customer's digital experience. To ensure performance quality extensively, a complete layered approach should be used to integrate protocol level performance testing, traditional performance and load testing with application level performance testing. Testing application performance should be executed as quickly as possible in the development lifecycle to avoid poor performance and ensure user customer retention. Given below are some essential tips for Application Level Performance Testing.

### **User Experience**

User experience sometimes cannot be properly assessed by your testers or developers. Their understanding of the application creates an unintended blindness that stops them from perceiving problems. User experience can be best assessed by real users, an external user experience expert, or both. The certain response time of application behavior may look usual for one user but will cause other users to uninstall it. It is preferable to use as many external, third-party users in your performance testing as possible so you can analyze feedback reviews to recognize their opinion about the app.

### **Crowd Testing**

Crowd testing lets you increase the benefit of different mindsets, geographies, configurations, handsets, and more. Run a load session where you ask hundreds, or even thousands, of real users to use your application in a certain load time. Offer incentives to the users to report problems to you; it can be either by dedicated communities, by social media, or by crowd sourcing companies. Crowd Testing is about as close to real life processes as you want it to be and can be a kind of hybrid load.

### **Load Testing **

A functional defect can only occur under a particular load; it would be tough to find and replicate that defect. Load testing services can help in measuring and evaluating the user experience under a varied load. By increasing the load, i.e. by increasing the number of concurrent users, you can check the behavior of the application under that load. Response time and staying power of the application can be monitored accurately while the application is under a specific load. Load testing services can be performed to test the amount of load that can be withstood by the application.

### **Testing Functional Scenarios With Different Connection Qualities**

Testing your application with different connection qualities and types, locations, and cellular operators can give you the confidence that is needed to ensure the app performs reliably and consistently across a wide range of infrastructures. Moreover, you get to see the app performing when the user changes their network from 3G to 4G or to a private network like LAN or WiFi.
