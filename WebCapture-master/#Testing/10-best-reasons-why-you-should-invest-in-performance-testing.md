**When was the last time you heard of a website crash during heavy traffic load?**

Website crashes and performance issues have been disrupting the online space. The recent crash was the most dramatic when the HBO website crashed as the famed fantasy show Game of Thrones Season 7 went live. On July 16, 2017, as this popular show went live, the streaming service of the HBO site crashed, which led to disappointed tweets from the fan club. Earlier in the year, the Nordstrom website crashed on a big shopping day, where the cardholders were unable to get early access to its Anniversary Sale. These and many such instances emphasize the need for investing in performance testing.

Performance testing helps to check the behavior of an application across various situations. A system can work effectively with a particular number of concurrent users, but might get dysfunctional with additional thousands during peak traffic. Performance tests help establish speed, scalability, and stability of the software application. There are varied types of performance tests that simulate various possible user scenarios and understand the behavior of the applications.

Increasing competition in the digital space and the need to be present in the top ranking of the category make performance testing critical for enterprises. Ensuring speed, stability, dependability, and scalability of the application is essential. An application is built with certain expectations and is supposed to give decided results. For instance, an online gaming application has to display certain actions to deliver the right experience.

Performance testing doesn't necessarily display defects with an application. It has to ensure that the application performs as expected irrespective of the network fluctuations, bandwidth availability, or the load of traffic. It is practically a subset of the wider performance engineering picture, focussing on performance issues in the design and architecture of a software. So, designing and executing these tests are critical for ensuring the stability of the website.

An effective performance testing strategy is essential for highlighting most of the performance issues. It could be associated with the database, network, software, bandwidth, or the hardware. Performance testing is done by following industry-defined benchmarks to ensure the application behaves in a particular way. Precision and close scrutiny of the testing results is the core responsibility of performance testing.

There are some key reasons why it is critical for enterprises/businesses to invest in performance testing. Automation of performance tests adds tremendous value to the application testing process. There are various tools that are being leveraged to weigh diverse aspects of the application - including licensed and open source tools.

### 1\. Engage Customers With Better Website Speed

A slow and lousy website will never draw a good audience. In fact, it will repel the crowd coming to the site. Automated testing tools enable teams to check the speed and performance of the website. In this way, with basic connectivity and bandwidth access, users will be able to load the site, which will sustain their interest and keep them engaged.

### 2\. The Faster the Website, the More Revenue It Will Generate

Though this holds true for almost all websites, it is of great relevance for businesses that need dir a ct interface with customers. For instance, banking applications and ecommerce applications have to provide an easy and secure gateway to the customers. Consequently, there is better traction and repeated visits on the application.

### 3\. Resolve Glitches Before It Goes to the Market

As mentioned earlier, performance testing is expected to ensure that the application performs the way it is expected. Various types of performance tests help you to achieve the expected results and resolve the risks that might impair the application in real world scenario.

Fail-over tests verify redundancy mechanisms, reliability tests run high level loads for longer span, and stress tests gauge the load that the system/application can take. This helps in exploiting the application to reveal glitches, as it is essential for making the application market-ready.

### 4\. Enhance the Application's Robustness

It is important for enterprises to ensure that the applications remain sturdy even during the most critical times - network issues, cyber-attacks, or virtual threats. Performance testing with various tests and tools ensures the sturdiness of the application to sustain in the marketplace and perform relentlessly.

For instance, targeted infrastructure tests are isolated tests that check each layer of an application to identify performance issues that can cause hiccups while delivering the desired performance.

### 5\. Support Market Claims

It is absolutely critical for businesses to verify that the application/software works the way it claims. This factor is most relevant for online gaming applications and software. It is expected to take the load of concurrent gamers and deliver the speed and performance as promised.

Various statistics are collected during the execution of tests to assure and meet performance goals, especially speed, scalability, and stability. This helps identify performance issues.

### 6\. Enhance Scalability

With the challenges in the digital space, enterprises need to build applications that are scalable and can get upgraded in real time. Performance testing exposes the possible vulnerabilities within an application and identifies where it has to be strengthened to accept upgrades and changes to get more scalable.

Analyzing the statistics from test executions can help teams to identify any possible issues and capabilities of an application.

### 7\. Bring Stability and Dependability Within an Application

An application in every possible form has to be stable and deliver consistent results, irrespective of any changes in its features. With specific performance tests teams are able to gauge whether any recent changes or frequent releases are causing disruption in the behaviour of the application.

### 8\. Check Various Technology Stacks

Software applications are getting complex, which has led to implementation of various technology stacks. This is critical for ensuring expected performance and deliverables. Performance testing helps identify the weak links within the technology stack that has been used for the application.

### 9\. Build Responsiveness of an Application

There are various freely available as well as paid tools to check the speed of websites and applications. Both open source as well as licensed tools can be implemented for ensuring performance tests.

Most of the performance testing tools are browser-based and testing can be done simultaneously to ensure that the application is compatible across various platforms and browsers. Responsiveness is absolutely critical for enterprises to achieve an organization's business objectives.

### 10\. Identify Issues Related to Database and APIs

Sourcing data and ensuring the performance of your Application Program Interface (API) is critical today. Performance tests such as load/stress tests not only enable teams to determine the behaviour of the application, but also help to check whether the server responds to the user with data in a stipulated time gap. It further helps to gauge the behaviour and performance of the API under heavy load, which is a must-do.

## In Conclusion

Investing in performance testing is obviously paramount today for the success of organizations that can select either open source or licensed testing tools for ensuring the best performance of their product. However, to ensure the best speed, reduce bugs, identify DB issues, and create a robust and responsive website or application, it is imperative to set clear testing objectives while choosing the right software testing tool, infrastructure, and technologies.
