We've already posted our [top 10 service virtualization resources](https://dzone.com/articles/top-10-service-virtualization-and-api-testing-reso). Now, here are the top 10 development testing resources from [Parasoft's resource center](https://www.parasoft.com/resources)!

## 1\. voke Research: Development Testing

This [new report by voke Research](https://alm.parasoft.com/voke-development-testing) explores how a development testing platform can help organizations leverage the power of data to reduce business risks across their applications and the SDLC.

## 2\. Continuous Testing for IT Leaders

Continuous Testing provides a real-time, objective assessment of the business risks associated with an application under development. Learn how in [this 70-page eBook](https://alm.parasoft.com/continuoustestingbook).

## 3\. Release = Merged, Correlated Coverage

[This on-demand webinar](https://alm.parasoft.com/merged-correlated-coverage-using-application-coverage-to-release-faster) explores methods and metrics to more rapidly assess the risk of a software release candidate, including the value of Merged, Correlated Coverage and how to implement and leverage this metric as a critical step toward assessing risk and prioritizing testing activities.

## 4\. Survey Results: How Teams Measure Non-Functional Requirements

To explore how SDLC acceleration initiatives are impacting software quality, Parasoft surveyed 780 software development professionals. [This report](https://alm.parasoft.com/nonfunctional-requirements-report) presents the key findings on quality in this era of Continuous Everything.

## 5\. How to Simplify Development Complexity

[Read voke's research](https://blog.parasoft.com/voke-development-testing-research) on how development teams can simplify integration, accelerate release cycles, reduce production defects, and prevent application security vulnerabilities.

## 6\. Testing 1-2-3 with Parasoft's Mark Lambert: Change-Based Testing and Merged Correlated Code Coverage

In [this edition of Testing 1-2-3](https://blog.parasoft.com/testing-123-change-based-testing-coverage), we chat with Mark Lambert, VP of Products at Parasoft, about change-based testing, merged, correlated code coverage, and Agile development.

## 7\. Electronics: PC Maker Enhances Enterprise User Experience w/ Static Analysis, Development Testing

A leading PC company wants to reduce field-reported defects for "preloaded" software. [Learn how](https://www.parasoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/StaticAnalysisPCCompany.pdf) they are using defect prevention practices such as static analysis to accelerate delivery while ensuring high reliability.

## 8\. Is "IoT Security" a Contradiction in Terms?

[The IoT is creating security risks](https://blog.parasoft.com/iot-security-shame) at a faster rate than it's fixing them, exposing us to direct control of devices, loss of personal private data, and actual takeover of networks and computers in our homes and offices.

## 9\. Why Cisco is Thankful for Static Analysis

Cisco Systems adopted static analysis, unit testing, and code review to comply with corporate quality and security initiatives. [Learn how](https://blog.parasoft.com/cisco-static-analysis-tools) it helped them deliver compliant code without impeding productivity.

## 10\. Why Appsec Vulnerabilities Are Dismissed as "Theoretical" or "False"

Why do software engineers and others engaged in application security marginalize the findings from their security tools? Find out [here](https://blog.parasoft.com/why-we-view-appsec-vulnerabilities-as-false).
