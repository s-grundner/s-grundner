In response to accelerated release cycles, a new set of testing capabilities is now required to deliver quality at speed. This is why there is a shake-up in the testing tools landscape--and a new leader has emerged in the just released [Gartner Magic Quadrant for Software Test Automation](https://dzone.com/go?i=265440&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tricentis.com%2Fresource-assets%2Fgartner-magic-quadrant-software-test-automation%2F%3Futm_source%3DDZone_Pre_Roll%26utm_medium%3DText_Ads%26utm_campaign%3DDZoneDevOps%26utm_content%3D2017GartnerMQ).

Exploratory testing is nothing new. In fact, industry leaders believe that _[all _software testing is actually what we've been calling "exploratory testing" ](https://www.tricentis.com/blog/2017/11/24/testing-vs-checking-exploratory-testing/)since [Cem Kaner coined the term in 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing). Moreover, the concept of exploratory testing is now so mature that many of its core evangelists are [retiring the term altogether](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/1509).

Nevertheless, the recent trend of organizations adopting and scaling Agile development processes has driven a sudden surge of interest in exploratory testing. More and more teams are now looking to exploratory testing as a [collaborative approach to Agile testing](https://www.techwell.com/techwell-insights/2017/03/3-reasons-exploratory-testing-great-agile-teams): a way to uncover more defects, faster.

This renewed interest in exploratory testing has set off a wave of innovation in exploratory testing tools. Sure, you **_could_** plan and track your exploratory testing with Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and manual screen captures. But why **_would_** you, now that you can take advantage of technologies that make exploratory testing planning, documentation, and reporting a breeze?

If you're looking to adopt or scale exploratory testing, here's a comprehensive comparison of the top exploratory testing tools that you might be considering. We've broken down the comparison criteria into four categories--planning, execution, reporting, and compatibility--and defined each comparison criteria following the tables.

## Exploratory Testing Tool Planning Criteria Definitions

**Utilize Session-Based Test Management**: The ability to use session-based test management to structure exploratory testing.

**Manage Multiple Testers / Session: **The ability to add more than one tester to a session to make exploratory testing applicable for large-scale implementations.

**Invite Testers: **The ability to invite testers to a session; the invite informs them about the session and provides a link that lets them join the session.

**Reject Session Invitation: **The ability to reject an invitation to a session; the rejection informs the session owner that a tester cannot join a session.

**Write Session Charter: **The ability to write a mission statement (testing goals, testing scope) for all testers of a session.

**Write Tester Charter: **The ability to assign additional test instructions to a specific tester in a session; this supplements the session charter.

**Define Test Objectives: ** The ability to define test objectives (e.g. user stories) to set the scope of a session in an unambiguous fashion; this prevents testers from drifting into unfocused exploration.

**Assign Test Objectives to Testers: **The ability to assign test objectives across the team to distribute the testing workload.

**Time-Box Session: **The ability to allocate a fixed period of time to a session in order to prevent testers from overcommitting to testing tasks.

**Attach Files to Sessions: **The ability to attach any kind of files (e.g. specifications) to a session and enrich what is stated in the (session, tester) charters.

**Configure E-Mail Notifications: **The ability to configure e-mail notifications and specify who should be informed about certain session changes (e.g. a tester completed a test).

**Configure Permissions: **The ability to configure permissions to define who should have the right to perform certain tasks (e.g. delete a session).

## Exploratory Testing Tool Execution Criteria Definitions

**Capture Videos: **The ability to capture videos during testing and link them to certain test actions; this helps document issues (e.g. bugs).

**Trim Videos: **The ability to trim recorded videos to increase focus and reduce the data volume.

**Annotate Videos: **The ability to add certain annotations (e.g. text, shapes) to videos; this helps document issues (e.g. bugs).

**Record Test Actions Automatically: **The ability to automatically record the user's mouse and keyboard interactions; this enables the testers to focus on testing, not on manual documentation.

**Link Session to Raised Issues:** The ability to link issues (e.g. bugs, feature requests) raised during testing to a session; this helps measure the effectiveness of a session.

**Link Session to Test Objectives**: The ability to link test objectives (e.g. user stories) to a session; this helps measure the overall session coverage.

**Link Scenarios to Raised Issues**: The ability to link one or more scenarios to issues (e.g. bugs) raised during testing; this allows other team members (e.g. developers) to see how these issues were found.
