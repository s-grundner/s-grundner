## What Is Test Data?

Test data is data which has been particularly distinguished for use in tests, normally of a PC program. Some data might be utilized as a part of a corroborative way, normally to check that a given set of contributions to a given capacity produces some normal outcome. Other data might be utilized as a part of a request to challenge the capacity of the program to react to unusual, extreme, exceptional, or unexpected input. Test data might be created in an engaged or efficient way (as is ordinarily the case in space testing), or by utilizing other, less-engaged methodologies (as is commonly the case in high-volume randomized computerized tests). Test data might be created by the tester, or by a program or function that guides the tester. Test data might be recorded for re-utilize, or utilized once and after that overlooked.

## What Is Test Data Generation? How Can We Generate It?

Test data generation, a critical piece of programming testing, is the way toward making a set of data for testing the sufficiency of new or updated programming applications. It might be the genuine data that has been taken from past operations or counterfeit data made for this reason. Test data generation apparently is a mind-boggling issue and though a ton of set has approached, the majority of them are constrained to toy programs. Test data can be created :

  * Manually
  * Mass copy of data from production to testing environment
  * Mass copy of test data from legacy client systems
  * Automated Test Data Generation Tools

## Why Is Data-Driven Testing Necessary?

After generating test data, you will want to execute them for many testing purposes. This time is to consider approaching data-driven testing. Data-driven testing is a term used in the testing of computer software to describe testing done using a table of conditions directly as test inputs and verifiable outputs as well as the process where test environment settings and control are not hard-coded. Katalon Studio supports **[data-driven testing](https://www.katalon.com/resources-center/tutorials/data-driven-testing/)** which allows users to define data sets and execute test scripts that use these data sets. The benefits of the data-driven testing include:

  * We can make our script notwithstanding when application development is yet processing
  * Redundancy and unnecessary duplication of test scripts are reduced
  * Generates test scripts with less amount of code
  * All information like inputs, outputs, and expected result is stored in the form of appropriately managed text records
  * Provides flexibility in application maintenance
  * In case of any change in functionality, we just need to adjust that specific function script.

**Some tips for good data-driven tests:**

  * Tests should create their own scenario data; never assume it already exists. Magic row IDs kill kittens!
  * Make liberal use of data helper and scenario setup classes.
  * Don't use your data access layer to test your data access layer.
  * Tests should make no permanent changes to the database - leave no data behind!
