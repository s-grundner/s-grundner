**FEMAIL consulted mathematician Hannah Fry to find out which answer is correct**

A mathematical equation that has been dividing internet users for five agonising days has finally been solved by a mathematician.

The sum was first posed on Twitter by user [Em](https://twitter.com/pjmdolI/status/1155598050959745026?s=20), who challenged people to solve '8÷2(2+2)=?'.

Her tweet notched up around 3,200 retweets and 13,000 likes, with dozens leaving their proposed answers in the comments.

But the internet was divided over whether the correct answer was one or 16, with many accusing people in the opposite camp to them of needing to 'retake maths'.

One angry person tweeted: '16... this is embarrasing for some of y'all,' while another frustrated maths fan wrote: 'I did not suffer through pre calc to see people saying that this is 16.' 

Here at FEMAIL we too were divided over which was the correct answer.

So we consulted Hannah Fry, an associate professor in the mathematics of cities at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London.

Hannah has written two popular maths books and her mathematical expertise has led to the development of several BBC documentaries including BBC2's City in the Sky, Britain's Greatest Inventions and Climate Change By Numbers (BBC4). 

Speaking about the equation, Hannah told FEMAIL: 'The problem with it is that the way it's written leaves room for ambiguity over the answer.

'The (2+2) in brackets is easy enough to deal with - it's equal to four. But then what does the rest of the equation mean? Is it 8÷(2x4) =1? Or is it (8÷2)x4 = 16? 

'This is like a maths version of the sentence "He fed her cat food". Does it mean the man gave some food to a cat? Or - slightly darker- fed some cat food to a woman. It's impossible to tell from the information we've been given.'

Hannah added that, as mathematicians 'really hate ambiguity', you're more likely to see them using fractions instead of the division, or obelus, symbol.

'Whenever we write equations, we try and make it so there's no possible way they can be misinterpreted,' she said. 

'The fraction forces whoever is writing the equation to choose. And be clearer about what they mean in the process. 

'So the answer then is that both one and 16 are correct, depending on how you interpret it. 

'But also, neither of them are, because it's just a badly written equation.' So there you go.
