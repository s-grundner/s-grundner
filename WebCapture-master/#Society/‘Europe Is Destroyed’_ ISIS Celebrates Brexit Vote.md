Britain voted to leave the European Union Thursday, in a shocking move that's already sent global markets tumbling and prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to announce his resignation. Watching the upheaval from the Brexit start to reverberate, supporters of the Islamic State are celebrating online in forums and social media, proclaiming "Europe is destroyed!"

"At a time when Muslims are uniting under the flag of the Caliphate, Europe is choosing to divide and split. The victory is close with the help of God," [tweeted ](https://twitter.com/MarwanMuteir/status/746258378666672128)one supporter. Another supporter [said](https://twitter.com/pvcxxw/status/746259146459193344), "The rise of the Islamic State brought about the sinking of Britain and the collapse of the European Union."

Others [claimed](https://twitter.com/Golii8n/status/746284318834692096) that ISIS "will profit" from the British exit, since a weaker UK won't be able to continue supporting the Arab countries fighting the terror group, and taunted "[Rambo"](https://twitter.com/ga_adIII/status/746282017885667329) David Cameron, sharing quotes of him promising "to destroy the Caliphate," while then mocking him for ending up out of the EU (and a job) instead.

At lease three threads discussing the referendum were created on al-Minbar, one of the main online forums used by ISIS supporters. In one of the threads, titled "God is great, Europe is destroyed," dozens of supporters commented, sharing updates on the results and the "collapse of the stock markets in Europe."

"Their war against the Islamic State caused results they didn't expect, like immigration that worries and divides them and which caused the vote to exit Europe" wrote a supporter in the forum. Another comment celebrated the expected "domino effect" in Europe, saying that it will lead to the exit of other countries. In a thread created before the results, supporters hoped the British exit would also be "a blow for America."
