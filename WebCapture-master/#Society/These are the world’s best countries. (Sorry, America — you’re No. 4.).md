The inaugural "Best Countries" ranking was unveiled at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Jan. 20. Here are the top 5
countries according to U.S. News & World Report. (The Washington Post)

The votes are in, America, and the best country in the world is ...

(Drum roll, please.)

It's Germany. Sorry, United States, you're fourth — right behind third-ranked
Britain and second-ranked Canada. But, hey, America beat Sweden!

That's according to the [inaugural "Best Countries"
ranking](http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list) from
U.S. News & World Report, the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and
global brand consultants BAV Consulting. The ranking was officially unveiled
at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.

_[[Map: These are the world’s least religious
countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/14/map-
these-are-the-worlds-least-religious-countries/)]_

“Just as we have done with universities, hospitals and other institutions, our
Best Countries portal will be a global homepage for stories and data to help
citizens, business leaders and governments evaluate performance in a rapidly
changing world,” Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S.
News, said in a statement. The publication is known the world over for many of
its rankings.

![](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washington
post.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2016/01/Pasted_Image_1_19_16__11_36_PM.png&w=4
80)  

Germany secured its top spot for a number of reasons, its economy key among
them. The country is also, as U.S. News notes [in a country
profile](http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20
/germany-is-seen-as-the-no-1-country-in-the-world), home to low unemployment,
popular around the world, known for its high-quality brands and adept at using
soft power abroad. And U.S. News credits Germany's leadership for its global
rise.

"Germany's ascendance as a world leader comes largely from the work of
[Chancellor Angela] Merkel," Drew writes. "Only the third German since World
War II to hold the chancellorship for a decade or more, Merkel has shown
decisive leadership on several issues. That is a change. Traditionally,
Germans are consensus seekers who have chosen multilateral strategies over
acting in a singularized manner."

Naturally, the rankings prompted official responses from officials around the
world.

The new project ranks 60 countries across 24 categories and is based on a
survey of more than 16,000 people.

The United States ranked first in power and influence. Sweden scored the most
top spots, ranking first for being the best country for citizenship, raising
kids and green living. Other top rankings include Brazil for adventure;
Luxembourg for opening a business; France for cultural influence; Germany for
entrepreneurship; Canada for quality of life; Italy for heritage; and India
for its up-and-coming economy. In the end, Germany scored highest overall.

0)  

The ranking relied on surveys from 16,248 people from 36 countries in the
Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa. Of those, more than 8,000 were "informed
elites" (college-educated, middle- or upper-class individuals). More than
4,500 were business leaders, defined as senior leaders in an organization or
individuals who own small business that employ others. The rest belonged to
the general public.

_[[The happiest countries in the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news
/on-leadership/wp/2015/04/23/the-happiest-countries-in-the-world/)]_

Each respondent was asked to share his or her perceptions on a random
selection of 65 attributes for a random selection of countries. The attributes
were each scored and grouped into nine broader categories: adventure,
citizenship, cultural influence, entrepreneurship, heritage, movers, open for
business, power and quality of life.

Scores in each category were then weighted based on correlation with
widespread prosperity, measured using the International Monetary Fund's 2014
per capita gross domestic product purchasing power parity.

The 60 countries included were chosen based on other key business, economic
and quality of life indicators.

Robots, jobs and refugees will all be on the agenda as business leaders and
politicians gather for the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. But
will they achieve anything? (Reuters)
