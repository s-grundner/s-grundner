The website or mobile app is the storefront for participating in the modern digital era. It's your portal for inviting users to come and survey your products and services. Much of the user's attention focuses on aspects of front-end development; this is where the HMTL5, CSS, and JavaScript are coded to develop the landing page that everyone sees when they visit your site.

But the real magic happens on the backend. This is the ecosystem that really powers your website. One writer [has articulated ](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/back-end-web-developer/)this point very nicely as follows:

> The technology and programming that "power" a site--what your end user doesn't see but what makes the site run--is called the backend. Consisting of the server, the database, and the server-side applications, it's the behind-the-scenes functionality--the brain of a site. This is the ecosystem of the database manager and the backend developer. 

The challenge of modern web development is that the tools and technologies are constantly changing. What's in vogue today may become obsolete in less than a year. What's more is that web applications have become much richer and more complex. New uses of video, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence on websites will continue to define the developer of the future.

And, of course, today's savvy web developer must continue to learn and grow, which is equally challenging because the technologies are constantly changing. The internet of 3 years ago, is very different from the internet of today, and so it will be in another 3 years.

In the following article, we've put together a long list of useful tools that every backend developer should have in their toolkit. Read on and learn about some of the best resources on the market today for the backend developer.

## Languages and Frameworks

In the 23 years since its introduction, PHP has become the world's most popular server-side scripting language. PHP is pre-installed on most hosting sites, is known to be easy to use, and has tons of support. What's more, there are many very well established PHP frameworks on the market that make developing applications more intuitive and agile. Some of the most popular ones are [Symfony](http://symfony.com/), [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Phalcon](http://phalconphp.com/en/), and [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/).

**2\. [Python](https://www.python.org/)**

Python has become an extremely popular language for building applications in recent years. With a reputation for being fast, easy to learn, and carrying wide support, Python has become the [first choice](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2452940/learn-java/python-bumps-off-java-as-top-learning-language.html) for many new programmers. It's also the language of choice for data scientists and engineers. A couple of the most popular Python frameworks out there are [Django ](https://www.djangoproject.com/)and [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/).

**3\. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)**

Ruby on Rails is the popular open source web application framework that uses the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Ever since Rails burst on the scene a decade ago it has continued to scale up as an elegant way to build dynamic websites quickly and efficiently. Rails has garnered a strong following, especially among tech start-ups. In fact, some of the best-known firms out there are using this framework to build their sites, including Airbnb, Bloomberg, and Groupon.

**4\. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of server tools and applications. One notable feature of Node.js is that it contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.

**5\. [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)**

Laravel is probably one of the more popular PHP frameworks on the market right now. Known for its elegance and simplicity, Laravel meets a diverse range of programming needs and projects, from beginner to advanced, and is well suited for projects of all types and sizes - from basic scripting to huge enterprise applications. It's built on top of several Symfony components that ensure a solid framework for producing well-tested and reliable code.

## Web Server Technologies

Apache is an open source web server, created in 1999 and currently [used by 50.1% of all websites](http://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/web_server/ranking). The numbers indicate the reliance that folks place on Apache to run their web services. It's a proven, reliable tool that has stood the test of time, and really played a key role in the early growth of the internet.

**7\. [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/)**

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

## Databases

MySQL is the world's most popular open source relational database. It's easily accessible and is often known to be part of the LAMP web development stack, standing for the 'M' in the acronym of popular tools, along with Linux, Apache, and PHP/Perl/Python. The fact that MySQL is free, easy to setup, and scales fast are some of the main reasons why it's the best match for many backend developers.

**9\. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

**10\. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb)**

MongoDB is a free and open source NoSQL database system. MongoDB saves data in binary JSON format which makes it easier to pass data between client and server. The platform is closely associated with MEAN (an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js), a JavaScript based set of technologies used for building web applications.

## Git Clients and Services

**11\. [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)**

SourceTree simplifies the process of how developers interact with their Git and Mercurial repositories. The easy to use interface makes managing repositories more intuitive so you can focus on coding.
