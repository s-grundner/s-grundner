# 11 IoT Programming Languages Worth Knowing

Choosing which language to use for an Internet of Things project can be as big a decision as choosing a hardware platform. Here are 11 options to consider for your next coding project. 

![C
It makes sense that a language first developed to program telephone switches would be a reasonable choice for embedded system development. C is as close to a lingua franca as exists in the world of software development: It's available on nearly every advanced embedded system platform that exists. For some platforms where it's not directly available, it's still the basis for the dedicated language used in the SDK.
The odds are good that professional programmers have at least a passing knowledge of C already -- and if they don't, an investment in learning C should pay off for both the programmer's career and your enterprise development efforts in the future. In today's terms, C is a bit of a throwback: It's procedural rather than object-oriented. It doesn't come with a built-in bias toward a graphical user interface, and it's compiled rather than interpreted. All of those factors, though, make it a strong candidate for just about any IoT development effort.

## C

It makes sense that a language first developed to program telephone switches would be a reasonable choice for embedded system development. C is as close to a _lingua franca_ as exists in the world of software development: It's available on nearly every advanced embedded system platform that exists. For some platforms where it's not directly available, it's still the basis for the dedicated language used in the SDK.
