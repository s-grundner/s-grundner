Choosing which language to use for an Internet of Things project can be as big a decision as choosing a hardware platform. Here are 11 options to consider for your next coding project. 

![Python
A language designed during a holiday break and named after a famous comedy troupe seems an unlikely candidate for serious development. Nevertheless, Python has become one of the 'go-to' languages in Web development, and its use has spread to the embedded control and IoT world. Python is very flexible in many ways. For example, it is an interpreted language that can either be submitted to a run-time compiler or run through one of several pre-compilers so that compact executable code may be distributed.
The thing that makes Python good for programming teams, though, is its emphasis on readability. The design specs for the language mention the importance of readable code and compact, elegant syntax. Anyone who's ever tried to unravel someone else's optimized C code can appreciate the benefits of highly readable code.
As with so many of these languages, Python's possibility as an embedded language rests on having sufficient power in the embedded platform. For any applications that will take data, put it into any sort of database format, then draw upon the tables for control information, Python is a very real contender.
