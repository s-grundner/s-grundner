[Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify), with a net worth of [$26 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/spotify-chiefs-net-worth-tops-2-billion-after-nyse-debut.html) is reigning the [music streaming platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_on-demand_streaming_music_services) today. It currently has millions of songs in its database and claims to have the right music score for everyone. **Spotify's Discover Weekly** service has become a hit with the millennials.

Songs are analyzed based on their digital signatures for some factors, including tempo, acoustics, energy, danceability etc. to answer that impossible old first-date query: **What kind of music are you into?**
