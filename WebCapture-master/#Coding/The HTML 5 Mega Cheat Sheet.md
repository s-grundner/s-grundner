## 30 Jun The HTML 5 Mega Cheat Sheet

Cheat sheets; don't you just love them?

I love them as they offer me a simple way to recall a software program or help me to learn a new skill. Plus there's always a useful keyboard shortcut to forget, a command you will just fail to remember, a newly introduced function that slips your mind or element you cease to think of.

So to get things rolling with my up and coming series of HTML5 tutorials and guides which I will be sharing on MakeaWebsiteHub.com I have spent the last few days creating this "Mega" cheat sheet for all you front end types to get your little hands on. So whether you are a web design novice or a seasoned grizzly veteran this will hopefully come in use for your next project.

Of course if you want to share this piece on your blog, Tumblr or website then there is an embed code at the bottom of the page.
