Choosing which language to use for an Internet of Things project can be as big a decision as choosing a hardware platform. Here are 11 options to consider for your next coding project. 

![C++
When the programming world began moving toward object-oriented languages in the early 1980s, procedural languages such as Fortran, Cobol, and C seemed destined to fade into obscurity. While Fortran and Cobol have become niche languages \(sure, Cobol is a big niche, but still …\), C retained its relevance due to the work of Bjarne Stroustrup, who developed an object-oriented pre-processor for C -- a pre-processor that came to be called C++.
C++ kept the spare nature of C but added data abstraction, classes, and objects. All of these features make C++ a popular choice for those who are writing embedded and IoT code for Linux systems. This programming language still is going strong after more than 30 years in the field.
