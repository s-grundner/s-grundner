Choosing which language to use for an Internet of Things project can be as big a decision as choosing a hardware platform. Here are 11 options to consider for your next coding project. 

![Assembler
When you want to go truly old-school, or you need to keep your project as compact as possible, then assembler is the path you'll take. Assembler is a way of packaging and building the pure machine code that's ultimately executed by the processor. The good news is that the overhead is absolutely minimal, and an expert can pull optimizing tricks simply not available in any other programming method.
The bad news is that assembler programming is coding without a net: You have practically no useful tools to keep you from making silly mistakes. It's also true that assembler code and the skills for writing programs in it are absolutely not transferable. Just because you can write for one processor, it doesn't follow that you can write assembler for any other.
For hardcore programmers and the final, optimized version of shipping products, assembler can get you into small spaces that just won't hold any other environment. It's absolutely not the most efficient way to go for prototyping, though -- and if you have enough space and power to make use of a higher-level language, you should take advantage of the modern world.
