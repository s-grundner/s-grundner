_Captured: 2017-12-27 at 13:21 from [dzone.com](https://dzone.com/articles/15-great-programming-blogs-you-may-not-have-heard?edition=347121&utm_source=Daily%20Digest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily%20Digest%202017-12-24)_

The goal of this roundup is to help you discover new programming blogs that may not be insanely popular, but are still worth checking out. We won't mention the obvious super stars such as [Adam Bien](http://www.adam-bien.com/), [OverOps](https://blog.takipi.com/) or [JOOQ](https://blog.jooq.org/). Instead, we'll shed some light on individual authors who put out great content, but haven't gotten into major spotlight just yet.

I hope you'll find the recommendations useful! Blogs appear in alphabetical order sorted by the author's last name.
