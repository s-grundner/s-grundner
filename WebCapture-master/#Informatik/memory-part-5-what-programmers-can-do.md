[_Editor's note: welcome to part 5 of Ulrich Drepper's "What every programmer should know about memory". This part is the first half of section 6, which discusses what programmers can do to improve the memory performance of their code. [Part 1](http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/), [part 2](http://lwn.net/Articles/252125/), [part 3](http://lwn.net/Articles/253361/), and [part 4](http://lwn.net/Articles/254445/) remain online for those who have not yet read them._]

## 6 What Programmers Can Do

After the descriptions in the previous sections it is clear that there are many, many opportunities for programmers to influence a program's performance, positively or negatively. And this is for memory-related operations only. We will proceed in covering the opportunities from the ground up, starting with the lowest levels of physical RAM access and L1 caches, up to and including OS functionality which influences memory handling.

### 6.1 Bypassing the Cache

When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.

For this and similar situations, processors provide support for _non-temporal_ write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory.

This might sound expensive but it does not have to be. The processor will try to use write-combining (see Section 3.3.3) to fill entire cache lines. If this succeeds no memory read operation is needed at all. For the x86 and x86-64 architectures a number of intrinsics are provided by gcc:

> 
>     #include <emmintrin.h>
>     void _mm_stream_si32(int *p, int a);
>     void _mm_stream_si128(int *p, __m128i a);
>     void _mm_stream_pd(double *p, __m128d a);
>     
>     #include <xmmintrin.h>
>     void _mm_stream_pi(__m64 *p, __m64 a);
>     void _mm_stream_ps(float *p, __m128 a);
>     
>     #include <ammintrin.h>
>     void _mm_stream_sd(double *p, __m128d a);
>     void _mm_stream_ss(float *p, __m128 a);
>     

These instructions are used most efficiently if they process large amounts of data in one go. Data is loaded from memory, processed in one or more steps, and then written back to memory. The data "streams" through the processor, hence the names of the intrinsics.

The memory address must be aligned to 8 or 16 bytes respectively. In code using the multimedia extensions it is possible to replace the normal _mm_store_* intrinsics with these non-temporal versions. In the matrix multiplication code in Section 9.1 we do not do this since the written values are reused in a short order of time. This is an example where using the stream instructions is not useful. More on this code in Section 6.2.1.

The processor's write-combining buffer can hold requests for partial writing to a cache line for only so long. It is generally necessary to issue all the instructions which modify a single cache line one after another so that the write-combining can actually take place. An example for how to do this is as follows:

> 
>     #include <emmintrin.h>
>     void setbytes(char *p, int c)
>     {
>       __m128i i = _mm_set_epi8(c, c, c, c,
>                                c, c, c, c,
>                                c, c, c, c,
>                                c, c, c, c);
>       _mm_stream_si128((__m128i *)&p[0], i);
>       _mm_stream_si128((__m128i *)&p[16], i);
>       _mm_stream_si128((__m128i *)&p[32], i);
>       _mm_stream_si128((__m128i *)&p[48], i);
>     }
>     

Assuming the pointer p is appropriately aligned, a call to this function will set all bytes of the addressed cache line to c. The write-combining logic will see the four generated movntdq instructions and only issue the write command for the memory once the last instruction has been executed. To summarize, this code sequence not only avoids reading the cache line before it is written, it also avoids polluting the cache with data which might not be needed soon. This can have huge benefits in certain situations. An example of everyday code using this technique is the memset function in the C runtime, which should use a code sequence like the above for large blocks.

Some architectures provide specialized solutions. The PowerPC architecture defines the dcbz instruction which can be used to clear an entire cache line. The instruction does not really bypass the cache since a cache line is allocated for the result, but no data is read from memory. It is more limited than the non-temporal store instructions since a cache line can only be set to all-zeros and it pollutes the cache (in case the data is non-temporal), but no write-combining logic is needed to achieve the results.

To see the non-temporal instructions in action we will look at a new test which is used to measure writing to a matrix, organized as a two-dimensional array. The compiler lays out the matrix in memory so that the leftmost (first) index addresses the row which has all elements laid out sequentially in memory. The right (second) index addresses the elements in a row. The test program iterates over the matrix in two ways: first by increasing the column number in the inner loop and then by increasing the row index in the inner loop. This means we get the behavior shown in Figure 6.1.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.36.png)
> 
> > _Figure 6.1: Matrix Access Pattern_

We measure the time it takes to initialize a 3000Ã—3000 matrix. To see how memory behaves, we use store instructions which do not use the cache. On IA-32 processors the "non-temporal hint" is used for this. For comparison we also measure ordinary store operations. The results can be seen in Table 6.1.

For the normal writes which do use the cache we see the expected result: if memory is used sequentially we get a much better result, 0.048s for the whole operation translating to about 750MB/s, compared to the more-or-less random access which takes 0.127s (about 280MB/s). The matrix is large enough that the caches are essentially ineffective.

The part we are mainly interested in here are the writes bypassing the cache. It might be surprising that the sequential access is just as fast here as in the case where the cache is used. The reason for this behavior is that the processor is performing write-combining as explained above. Additionally, the memory ordering rules for non-temporal writes are relaxed: the program needs to explicitly insert memory barriers (sfence instructions for the x86 and x86-64 processors). This means the processor has more freedom to write back the data and thereby using the available bandwidth as well as possible.

In the case of column-wise access in the inner loop the situation is different. The results are significantly slower than in the case of cached accesses (0.16s, about 225MB/s). Here we can see that no write combining is possible and each memory cell must be addressed individually. This requires constantly selecting new rows in the RAM chips with all the associated delays. The result is a 25% worse result than the cached run.

On the read side, processors, until recently, lacked support aside from weak hints using non-temporal access (NTA) prefetch instructions. There is no equivalent to write-combining for reads, which is especially bad for uncacheable memory such as memory-mapped I/O. Intel, with the SSE4.1 extensions, introduced NTA loads. They are implemented using a small number of streaming load buffers; each buffer contains a cache line. The first movntdqa instruction for a given cache line will load a cache line into a buffer, possibly replacing another cache line. Subsequent 16-byte aligned accesses to the same cache line will be serviced from the load buffer at little cost. Unless there are other reasons to do so, the cache line will not be loaded into a cache, thus enabling the loading of large amounts of memory without polluting the caches. The compiler provides an intrinsic for this instruction:

> 
>     #include <smmintrin.h>
>     __m128i _mm_stream_load_si128 (__m128i *p);
>     

This intrinsic should be used multiple times, with addresses of 16-byte blocks passed as the parameter, until each cache line is read. Only then should the next cache line be started. Since there are a few streaming read buffers it might be possible to read from two memory locations at once.

What we should take away from this experiment is that modern CPUs very nicely optimize uncached write and (more recently) read accesses as long as they are sequential. This knowledge can come in very handy when handling large data structures which are used only once. Second, caches can help to cover up some--but not all--of the costs of random memory access. Random access in this example is 70% slower due to the implementation of RAM access. Until the implementation changes, random accesses should be avoided whenever possible.

In the section about prefetching we will again take a look at the non-temporal flag.

### 6.2 Cache Access

The most important improvements a programmer can make with respect to caches are those which affect the level 1 cache. We will discuss it first before including the other levels. Obviously, all the optimizations for the level 1 cache also affect the other caches. The theme for all memory access is the same: improve locality (spatial and temporal) and align the code and data.

**6.2.1 Optimizing Level 1 Data Cache Access**

In section Section 3.3 we have already seen how much the effective use of the L1d cache can improve performance. In this section we will show what kinds of code changes can help to improve that performance. Continuing from the previous section, we first concentrate on optimizations to access memory sequentially. As seen in the numbers of Section 3.3, the processor automatically prefetches data when memory is accessed sequentially.

The example code used is a matrix multiplication. We use two square matrices of 1000Ã—1000 double elements. For those who have forgotten the math, given two matrices A and B with elements aij and bij with 0 â‰¤ i,j < N the product is

> ![\[formula\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/matrixmult.png)
> 
> > _A straight-forward C implementation of this can look like this:_

> 
>       for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
>         for (j = 0; j < N; ++j)
>           for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
>             res[i][j] += mul1[i][k] * mul2[k][j];
>     

The two input matrices are mul1 and mul2. The result matrix res is assumed to be initialized to all zeroes. It is a nice and simple implementation. But it should be obvious that we have exactly the problem explained in Figure 6.1. While mul1 is accessed sequentially, the inner loop advances the row number of mul2. That means that mul1 is handled like the left matrix in Figure 6.1 while mul2 is handled like the right matrix. This cannot be good.

There is one possible remedy one can easily try. Since each element in the matrices is accessed multiple times it might be worthwhile to rearrange ("transpose," in mathematical terms) the second matrix mul2 before using it.

> ![\[formula\]](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/matrixmultT.png)

After the transposition (traditionally indicated by a superscript 'T') we now iterate over both matrices sequentially. As far as the C code is concerned, it now looks like this:

> 
>       double tmp[N][N];
>       for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
>         for (j = 0; j < N; ++j)
>           tmp[i][j] = mul2[j][i];
>       for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
>         for (j = 0; j < N; ++j)
>           for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
>             res[i][j] += mul1[i][k] * tmp[j][k];
>     

We create a temporary variable to contain the transposed matrix. This requires touching more memory, but this cost is, hopefully, recovered since the 1000 non-sequential accesses per column are more expensive (at least on modern hardware). Time for some performance tests. The results on a Intel Core 2 with 2666MHz clock speed are (in clock cycles):

Through the simple transformation of the matrix we can achieve a 76.6% speed-up! The copy operation is more than made up. The 1000 non-sequential accesses really hurt.

The next question is whether this is the best we can do. We certainly need an alternative method anyway which does not require the additional copy. We will not always have the luxury to be able to perform the copy: the matrix can be too large or the available memory too small.

The search for an alternative implementation should start with a close examination of the math involved and the operations performed by the original implementation. Trivial math knowledge allows us to see that the order in which the additions for each element of the result matrix are performed is irrelevant as long as each addend appears exactly once. {_We ignore arithmetic effects here which might change the occurrence of overflows, underflows, or rounding._} This understanding allows us to look for solutions which reorder the additions performed in the inner loop of the original code.

Now let us examine the actual problem in the execution of the original code. The order in which the elements of mul2 are accessed is: (0,0), (1,0), â€¦, (N-1,0), (0,1), (1,1), â€¦. The elements (0,0) and (0,1) are in the same cache line but, by the time the inner loop completes one round, this cache line has long been evicted. For this example, each round of the inner loop requires, for each of the three matrices, 1000 cache lines (with 64 bytes for the Core 2 processor). This adds up to much more than the 32k of L1d available.

But what if we handle two iterations of the middle loop together while executing the inner loop? In this case we use two double values from the cache line which is guaranteed to be in L1d. We cut the L1d miss rate in half. That is certainly an improvement, but, depending on the cache line size, it still might not be as good as we can get it. The Core 2 processor has a L1d cache line size of 64 bytes. The actual value can be queried using

> 
>     sysconf (_SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE)
>     

at runtime or using the getconf utility from the command line so that the program can be compiled for a specific cache line size. With sizeof(double) being 8 this means that, to fully utilize the cache line, we should unroll the middle loop 8 times. Continuing this thought, to effectively use the res matrix as well, i.e., to write 8 results at the same time, we should unroll the outer loop 8 times as well. We assume here cache lines of size 64 but the code works also well on systems with 32-byte cache lines since both cache lines are also 100% utilized. In general it is best to hardcode cache line sizes at compile time by using the getconf utility as in:

> 
>       gcc -DCLS=$(getconf LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE) ...
>     

If the binaries are supposed to be generic, the largest cache line size should be used. With very small L1ds this might mean that not all the data fits into the cache but such processors are not suitable for high-performance programs anyway. The code we arrive at looks something like this:

> 
>       #define SM (CLS / sizeof (double))
>     
>       for (i = 0; i < N; i += SM)
>           for (j = 0; j < N; j += SM)
>               for (k = 0; k < N; k += SM)
>                   for (i2 = 0, rres = &res[i][j],
>                        rmul1 = &mul1[i][k]; i2 < SM;
>                        ++i2, rres += N, rmul1 += N)
>                       for (k2 = 0, rmul2 = &mul2[k][j];
>                            k2 < SM; ++k2, rmul2 += N)
>                           for (j2 = 0; j2 < SM; ++j2)
>                               rres[j2] += rmul1[k2] * rmul2[j2];
>     

This looks quite scary. To some extent it is but only because it incorporates some tricks. The most visible change is that we now have six nested loops. The outer loops iterate with intervals of SM (the cache line size divided by sizeof(double)). This divides the multiplication in several smaller problems which can be handled with more cache locality. The inner loops iterate over the missing indexes of the outer loops. There are, once again, three loops. The only tricky part here is that the k2 and j2 loops are in a different order. This is done since, in the actual computation, only one expression depends on k2 but two depend on j2.

The rest of the complication here results from the fact that gcc is not very smart when it comes to optimizing array indexing. The introduction of the additional variables rres, rmul1, and rmul2 optimizes the code by pulling common expressions out of the inner loops, as far down as possible. The default aliasing rules of the C and C++ languages do not help the compiler making these decisions (unless restrict is used, all pointer accesses are potential sources of aliasing). This is why Fortran is still a preferred language for numeric programming: it makes writing fast code easier. {_In theory the restrict keyword introduced into the C language in the 1999 revision should solve the problem. Compilers have not caught up yet, though. The reason is mainly that too much incorrect code exists which would mislead the compiler and cause it to generate incorrect object code._}

How all this work pays off can be seen in Table 6.2.

> 16,765,297,870
> 3,922,373,010
> 2,895,041,480

> 
> 100%
> 23.4%
> 17.3%
> 9.47%
> 
> **Table 6.2: Matrix Multiplication Timing**

By avoiding the copying we gain another 6.1% of performance. Plus, we do not need any additional memory. The input matrices can be arbitrarily large as long as the result matrix fits into memory as well. This is a requirement for a general solution which we have now achieved.

There is one more column in Table 6.2 which has not been explained. Most modern processors nowadays include special support for vectorization. Often branded as multi-media extensions, these special instructions allow processing of 2, 4, 8, or more values at the same time. These are often SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, augmented by others to get the data in the right form. The SSE2 instructions provided by Intel processors can handle two double values in one operation. The instruction reference manual lists the intrinsic functions which provide access to these SSE2 instructions. If these intrinsics are used the program runs another 7.3% (relative to the original) faster. The result is a program which runs in 10% of the time of the original code. Translated into numbers which people recognize, we went from 318 MFLOPS to 3.35 GFLOPS. Since we are here only interested in memory effects here, the program code is pushed out into Section 9.1.

It should be noted that, in the last version of the code, we still have some cache problems with mul2; prefetching still will not work. But this cannot be solved without transposing the matrix. Maybe the cache prefetching units will get smarter to recognize the patterns, then no additional change would be needed. 3.19 GFLOPS on a 2.66 GHz processor with single-threaded code is not bad, though.

What we optimized in the example of the matrix multiplication is the use of the loaded cache lines. All bytes of a cache line are always used. We just made sure they are used before the cache line is evacuated. This is certainly a special case.

It is much more common to have data structures which fill one or more cache lines where the program uses only a few members at any one time. In Figure 3.11 we have already seen the effects of large structure sizes if only few members are used.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.37.png)
> 
> > _Figure 6.2: Spreading Over Multiple Cache Lines_

Figure 6.2 shows the results of yet another set of benchmarks performed using the by now well-known program. This time two values of the same list element are added. In one case, both elements are in the same cache line; in the other case, one element is in the first cache line of the list element and the second is in the last cache line. The graph shows the slowdown we are experiencing.

Unsurprisingly, in all cases there are no negative effects if the working set fits into L1d. Once L1d is no longer sufficient, penalties are paid by using two cache lines in the process instead of one. The red line shows the data when the list is laid out sequentially in memory. We see the usual two step patterns: about 17% penalty when the L2 cache is sufficient and about 27% penalty when the main memory has to be used.

In the case of random memory accesses the relative data looks a bit different. The slowdown for working sets which fit into L2 is between 25% and 35%. Beyond that it goes down to about 10%. This is not because the penalties get smaller but, instead, because the actual memory accesses get disproportionally more costly. The data also shows that, in some cases, the distance between the elements does matter. The Random 4 CLs curve shows higher penalties because the first and fourth cache lines are used.

An easy way to see the layout of a data structure compared to cache lines is to use the pahole program (see [dwarves]). This program examines the data structures defined in a binary. Take a program containing this definition:

> 
>     struct foo {
>       int a;
>       long fill[7];
>       int b;
>     };
>     

Compiled on a 64-bit machine, the output of pahole contains (among other things) the information shown in Figure 6.3.

> 
>     struct foo {
>             int                        a;                    /*     0     4 */
>     
>             /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */
>     
>             long int                   fill[7];              /*     8    56 */
>             /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) --- */
>             int                        b;                    /*    64     4 */
>     }; /* size: 72, cachelines: 2 */
>        /* sum members: 64, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
>        /* padding: 4 */
>        /* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
>     
> 
> **Figure 6.3: Output of pahole Run**

This output tells us a lot. First, it shows that the data structure uses up more than one cache line. The tool assumes the currently-used processor's cache line size, but this value can be overridden using a command line parameter. Especially in cases where the size of the structure is barely over the limit of a cache line, and many objects of this type are allocated, it makes sense to seek a way to compress that structure. Maybe a few elements can have a smaller type, or maybe some fields are actually flags which can be represented using individual bits.

In the case of the example the compression is easy and it is hinted at by the program. The output shows that there is a hole of four bytes after the first element. This hole is caused by the alignment requirement of the structure and the fill element. It is easy to see that the element b, which has a size of four bytes (indicated by the 4 at the end of the line), fits perfectly into the gap. The result in this case is that the gap no longer exists and that the data structure fits onto one cache line. The pahole tool can perform this optimization itself. If the --reorganize parameter is used and the structure name is added at the end of the command line the output of the tool is the optimized structure and the cache line use. Besides moving elements to fill gaps, the tool can also optimize bit fields and combine padding and holes. For more details see [dwarves].

Having a hole which is just large enough for the trailing element is, of course, the ideal situation. For this optimization to be useful it is required that the object itself is aligned to a cache line. We get to that in a bit.

The pahole output also makes it easier to determine whether elements have to be reordered so that those elements which are used together are also stored together. Using the pahole tool, it is easily possible to determine which elements are in the same cache line and when, instead, the elements have to be reshuffled to achieve that. This is not an automatic process but the tool can help quite a bit.

The position of the individual structure elements and the way they are used is important, too. As we have seen in Section 3.5.2 the performance of code with the critical word late in the cache line is worse. This means a programmer should always follow the following two rules:

  1. Always move the structure element which is most likely to be the critical word to the beginning of the structure. 

  2. When accessing the data structures, and the order of access is not dictated by the situation, access the elements in the order in which they are defined in the structure. 

For small structures, this means that the programmer should arrange the elements in the order in which they are likely accessed. This must be handled in a flexible way to allow the other optimizations, such as filling holes, to be applied as well. For bigger data structures each cache line-sized block should be arranged to follow the rules.

Reordering elements is not worth the time it takes, though, if the object itself is not aligned. The alignment of an object is determined by the alignment requirement of the data type. Each fundamental type has its own alignment requirement. For structured types the largest alignment requirement of any of its elements determines the alignment of the structure. This is almost always smaller than the cache line size. This means even if the members of a structure are lined up to fit into the same cache line an allocated object might not have an alignment matching the cache line size. There are two ways to ensure that the object has the alignment which was used when designing the layout of the structure:

  * the object can be allocated with an explicit alignment requirement. For dynamic allocation a call to malloc would only allocate the object with an alignment matching that of the most demanding standard type (usually long double). It is possible to use posix_memalign, though, to request higher alignments. 

> >     #include <stdlib.h>
>     int posix_memalign(void **memptr,
>                        size_t align,
>                        size_t size);
>     

The function stores the pointer to the newly-allocated memory in the pointer variable pointed to by memptr. The memory block is size bytes in size and is aligned on a align-byte boundary. 

For objects allocated by the compiler (in .data, .bss, etc, and on the stack) a variable attribute can be used: 

> >       struct strtype variable
>          __attribute((aligned(64)));
>     

In this case the variable is aligned at a 64 byte boundary regardless of the alignment requirement of the strtype structure. This works for global variables as well as automatic variables. 

This method does not work for arrays, though. Only the first element of the array would be aligned unless the size of each array element is a multiple of the alignment value. It also means that every single variable must be annotated appropriately. The use of posix_memalign is also not entirely free since the alignment requirements usually lead to fragmentation and/or higher memory consumption. 

  * the alignment requirement of a type can be changed using a type attribute: 

> >       struct strtype {
>         ...members...
>       } __attribute((aligned(64)));

This will cause the compiler to allocate all objects with the appropriate alignment, including arrays. The programmer has to take care of requesting the appropriate alignment for dynamically allocated objects, though. Here once again posix_memalign must be used. It is easy enough to use the alignof operator gcc provides and pass the value as the second parameter to posix_memalign. 

The multimedia extensions previously mentioned in this section almost always require that the memory accesses are aligned. I.e., for 16 byte memory accesses the address is supposed to be 16 byte aligned. The x86 and x86-64 processors have special variants of the memory operations which can handle unaligned accesses but these are slower. This hard alignment requirement is nothing new for most RISC architectures which require full alignment for all memory accesses. Even if an architecture supports unaligned accesses this is sometimes slower than using appropriate alignment, especially if the misalignment causes a load or store to use two cache lines instead of one.

> > _Figure 6.4: Overhead of Unaligned Accesses_

Figure 6.4 shows the effects of unaligned memory accesses. The now well-known tests which increment a data element while visiting memory (sequentially or randomly) are measured, once with aligned list elements and once with deliberately misaligned elements. The graph shows the slowdown the program incurs because of the unaligned accesses. The effects are more dramatic for the sequential access case than for the random case because, in the latter case, the costs of unaligned accesses are partially hidden by the generally higher costs of the memory access. In the sequential case, for working set sizes which do fit into the L2 cache, the slowdown is about 300%. This can be explained by the reduced effectiveness of the L1 cache. Some increment operations now touch two cache lines, and beginning work on a list element now often requires reading of two cache lines. The connection between L1 and L2 is simply too congested.

For very large working set sizes, the effects of the unaligned access are still 20% to 30%--which is a lot given that the aligned access time for those sizes is long. This graph should show that alignment must be taken seriously. Even if the architecture supports unaligned accesses, this must not be taken as "they are as good as aligned accesses".

There is some fallout from these alignment requirements, though. If an automatic variable has an alignment requirement, the compiler has to ensure that it is met in all situations. This is not trivial since the compiler has no control over the call sites and the way they handle the stack. This problem can be handled in two ways:

  1. The generated code actively aligns the stack, inserting gaps if necessary. This requires code to check for alignment, create alignment, and later undo the alignment. 
  2. Require that all callers have the stack aligned. 

All of the commonly used application binary interfaces (ABIs) follow the second route. Programs will likely fail if a caller violates the rule and alignment is needed in the callee. Keeping alignment intact does not come for free, though.

The size of a stack frame used in a function is not necessarily a multiple of the alignment. This means padding is needed if other functions are called from this stack frame. The big difference is that the stack frame size is, in most cases, known to the compiler and, therefore, it knows how to adjust the stack pointer to ensure alignment for any function which is called from that stack frame. In fact, most compilers will simply round the stack frame size up and be done with it.

This simple way to handle alignment is not possible if variable length arrays (VLAs) or alloca are used. In that case, the total size of the stack frame is only known at runtime. Active alignment control might be needed in this case, making the generated code (slightly) slower.

On some architectures, only the multimedia extensions require strict alignment; stacks on those architectures are always minimally aligned for the normal data types, usually 4 or 8 byte alignment for 32- and 64-bit architectures respectively. On these systems, enforcing the alignment incurs unnecessary costs. That means that, in this case, we might want to get rid of the strict alignment requirement if we know that it is never depended upon. Tail functions (those which call no other functions) which do no multimedia operations do not need alignment. Neither do functions which only call functions which need no alignment. If a large enough set of functions can be identified, a program might want to relax the alignment requirement. For x86 binaries gcc has support for relaxed stack alignment requirements:

> 
>       -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
>     

If this option is given a value of N, the stack alignment requirement will be set to 2N bytes. So, if a value of 2 is used, the stack alignment requirement is reduced from the default (which is 16 bytes) to just 4 bytes. In most cases this means no additional alignment operation is needed since normal stack push and pop operations work on four-byte boundaries anyway. This machine-specific option can help to reduce code size and also improve execution speed. But it cannot be applied for many other architectures. Even for x86-64 it is generally not applicable since the x86-64 ABI requires that floating-point parameters are passed in an SSE register and the SSE instructions require full 16 byte alignment. Nevertheless, whenever the option is usable it can make a noticeable difference.

Efficient placement of structure elements and alignment are not the only aspects of data structures which influence cache efficiency. If an array of structures is used, the entire structure definition affects performance. Remember the results in Figure 3.11: in this case we had increasing amounts of unused data in the elements of the array. The result was that prefetching was increasingly less effective and the program, for large data sets, became less efficient.

For large working sets it is important to use the available cache as well as possible. To achieve this, it might be necessary to rearrange data structures. While it is easier for the programmer to put all the data which conceptually belongs together in the same data structure, this might not be the best approach for maximum performance. Assume we have a data structure as follows:

> 
>       struct order {
>         double price;
>         bool paid;
>         const char *buyer[5];
>         long buyer_id;
>       };
>     

Further assume that these records are stored in a big array and that a frequently-run job adds up the expected payments of all the outstanding bills. In this scenario, the memory used for the buyer and buyer_id fields is unnecessarily loaded into the caches. Judging from the data in Figure 3.11 the program will perform up to 5 times worse than it could.

It is much better to split the order data structure in two, storing the first two fields in one structure and the other fields elsewhere. This change certainly increases the complexity of the program, but the performance gains might justify this cost.

Finally, let's consider another cache use optimization which, while also applying to the other caches, is primarily felt in the L1d access. As seen in Figure 3.8 an increased associativity of the cache benefits normal operation. The larger the cache, the higher the associativity usually is. The L1d cache is too large to be fully associative but not large enough to have the same associativity as L2 caches. This can be a problem if many of the objects in the working set fall into the same cache set. If this leads to evictions due to overuse of a set, the program can experience delays even though much of the cache is unused. These cache misses are sometimes called _conflict misses_. Since the L1d addressing uses virtual addresses, this is actually something the programmer can have control over. If variables which are used together are also stored together the likelihood of them falling into the same set is minimized. Figure 6.5 shows how quickly the problem can hit.

> > _Figure 6.5: Cache Associativity Effects_

In the figure, the now familiar Follow {_The test was performed on a 32-bit machine, hence NPAD=15 means one 64-byte cache line per list element._} with NPAD=15 test is measured with a special setup. The X-axis is the distance between two list elements, measured in empty list elements. In other words, a distance of 2 means that the next element's address is 128 bytes after the previous one. All elements are laid out in the virtual address space with the same distance. The Y-axis shows the total length of the list. Only one to 16 elements are used, meaning that the total working set size is 64 to 1024 bytes. The z-axis shows the average number of cycles needed to traverse each list element.

The result shown in the figure should not be surprising. If few elements are used, all the data fits into L1d and the access time is only 3 cycles per list element. The same is true for almost all arrangements of the list elements: the virtual addresses are nicely mapped to L1d slots with almost no conflicts. There are two (in this graph) special distance values for which the situation is different. If the distance is a multiple of 4096 bytes (i.e., distance of 64 elements) and the length of the list is greater than eight, the average number of cycles per list element increases dramatically. In these situations all entries are in the same set and, once the list length is greater than the associativity, entries are flushed from L1d and have to be re-read from L2 the next round. This results in the cost of about 10 cycles per list element.

With this graph we can determine that the processor used has an L1d cache with associativity 8 and a total size of 32kB. That means that the test could, if necessary, be used to determine these values. The same effects can be measured for the L2 cache but, here, it is more complex since the L2 cache is indexed using physical addresses and it is much larger.

For programmers this means that associativity is something worth paying attention to. Laying out data at boundaries that are powers of two happens often enough in the real world, but this is exactly the situation which can easily lead to the above effects and degraded performance. Unaligned accesses can increase the probability of conflict misses since each access might require an additional cache line.

> **Figure 6.6: Bank Address of L1d on AMD**

If this optimization is performed, another related optimization is possible, too. AMD's processors, at least, implement the L1d as several individual banks. The L1d can receive two data words per cycle but only if both words are stored in different banks or in a bank with the same index. The bank address is encoded in the low bits of the virtual address as shown in Figure 6.6. If variables which are used together are also stored together the likelihood that they are in different banks or the same bank with the same index is high.

**6.2.2 Optimizing Level 1 Instruction Cache Access**

Preparing code for good L1i use needs similar techniques as good L1d use. The problem is, though, that the programmer usually does not directly influence the way L1i is used unless s/he writes code in assembler. If compilers are used, programmers can indirectly determine the L1i use by guiding the compiler to create a better code layout.

Code has the advantage that it is linear between jumps. In these periods the processor can prefetch memory efficiently. Jumps disturb this nice picture because

  * the jump target might not be statically determined; 
  * and even if it is static the memory fetch might take a long time if it misses all caches. 

These problems create stalls in execution with a possibly severe impact on performance. This is why today's processors invest heavily in branch prediction (BP). Highly specialized BP units try to determine the target of a jump as far ahead of the jump as possible so that the processor can initiate loading the instructions at the new location into the cache. They use static and dynamic rules and are increasingly good at determining patterns in execution.

Getting data into the cache as soon as possible is even more important for the instruction cache. As mentioned in Section 3.1, instructions have to be decoded before they can be executed and, to speed this up (important on x86 and x86-64), instructions are actually cached in the decoded form, not in the byte/word form read from memory.

To achieve the best L1i use programmers should look out for at least the following aspects of code generation:

  1. reduce the code footprint as much as possible. This has to be balanced with optimizations like loop unrolling and inlining. 
  2. code execution should be linear without bubbles. {_Bubbles describe graphically the holes in the execution in the pipeline of a processor which appear when the execution has to wait for resources. For more details the reader is referred to literature on processor design._} 
  3. aligning code when it makes sense. 

We will now look at some compiler techniques available to help with optimizing programs according to these aspects.

Compilers have options to enable levels of optimization; specific optimizations can also be individually enabled. Many of the optimizations enabled at high optimization levels (-O2 and -O3 for gcc) deal with loop optimizations and function inlining. In general, these are good optimizations. If the code which is optimized in these ways accounts for a significant part of the total execution time of the program, overall performance can be improved. Inlining of functions, in particular, allows the compiler to optimize larger chunks of code at a time which, in turn, enables the generation of machine code which better exploits the processor's pipeline architecture. The handling of both code and data (through dead code elimination or value range propagation, and others) works better when larger parts of the program can be considered as a single unit.

A larger code size means higher pressure on the L1i (and also L2 and higher level) caches. This _can_ lead to less performance. Smaller code can be faster. Fortunately gcc has an optimization option to specify this. If -Os is used the compiler will optimize for code size. Optimizations which are known to increase the code size are disabled. Using this option often produces surprising results. Especially if the compiler cannot really take advantage of loop unrolling and inlining, this option is a big win.

Inlining can be controlled individually as well. The compiler has heuristics and limits which guide inlining; these limits can be controlled by the programmer. The -finline-limit option specifies how large a function must be to be considered too large for inlining. If a function is called in multiple places, inlining it in all of them would cause an explosion in the code size. But there is more. Assume a function inlcand is called in two functions f1 and f2. The functions f1 and f2 are themselves called in sequence.

> With inlining Without inlining
>     
>     
>     start f1
>       code f1
>       inlined inlcand
>       more code f1
>     end f1
>     
>     start f2
>       code f2
>       inlined inlcand
>       more code f2
>     end f2
>     
>     
>     
>     start inlcand
>       code inlcand
>     end inlcand
>     
>     start f1
>       code f1
>     end f1
>     
>     start f2
>       code f2
>     end f2
>     
> 
> **Table 6.3: Inlining Vs Not**

Table 6.3 shows how the generated code could look like in the cases of no inline and inlining in both functions. If the function inlcand is inlined in both f1 and f2 the total size of the generated code is:

> size f1 + size f2 + 2 Ã— size inlcand 

If no inlining happens, the total size is smaller by size inlcand. This is how much more L1i and L2 cache is needed if f1 and f2 are called shortly after one another. Plus: if inlcand is not inlined, the code might still be in L1i and it will not have to be decoded again. Plus: the branch prediction unit might do a better job of predicting jumps since it has already seen the code. If the compiler default for the upper limit on the size of inlined functions is not the best for the program, it should be lowered.

There are cases, though, when inlining always makes sense. If a function is only called once it might as well be inlined. This gives the compiler the opportunity to perform more optimizations (like value range propagation, which might significantly improve the code). That inlining might be thwarted by the selection limits. gcc has, for cases like this, an option to specify that a function is always inlined. Adding the always_inline function attribute instructs the compiler to do exactly what the name suggests.

In the same context, if a function should never be inlined despite being small enough, the noinline function attribute can be used. Using this attribute makes sense even for small functions if they are called often from different places. If the L1i content can be reused and the overall footprint is reduced this often makes up for the additional cost of the extra function call. Branch prediction units are pretty good these days. If inlining can lead to more aggressive optimizations things look different. This is something which must be decided on a case-by-case basis.

The always_inline attribute works well if the inline code is always used. But what if this is not the case? What if the inlined function is called only occasionally:

> 
>       void fct(void) {
>         ... code block A ...
>        if (condition)
>          inlfct()
>        ... code block C ...
>       }
>     

The code generated for such a code sequence in general matches the structure of the sources. That means first comes the code block A, then a conditional jump which, if the condition evaluates to false, jumps forward. The code generated for the inlined inlfct comes next, and finally the code block C. This looks all reasonable but it has a problem.

If the condition is frequently false, the execution is not linear. There is a big chunk of unused code in the middle which not only pollutes the L1i due to prefetching, it also can cause problems with branch prediction. If the branch prediction is wrong the conditional expression can be very inefficient.

This is a general problem and not specific to inlining functions. Whenever conditional execution is used and it is lopsided (i.e., the expression far more often leads to one result than the other) there is the potential for false static branch prediction and thus bubbles in the pipeline. This can be prevented by telling the compiler to move the less often executed code out of the main code path. In that case the conditional branch generated for an if statement would jump to a place out of the order as can be seen in the following figure.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.38.png)

The upper parts represents the simple code layout. If the area B, e.g. generated from the inlined function inlfct above, is often not executed because the conditional I jumps over it, the prefetching of the processor will pull in cache lines containing block B which are rarely used. Using block reordering this can be changed, with a result that can be seen in the lower part of the figure. The often-executed code is linear in memory while the rarely-executed code is moved somewhere where it does not hurt prefetching and L1i efficiency.

gcc provides two methods to achieve this. First, the compiler can take profiling output into account while recompiling code and lay out the code blocks according to the profile. We will see how this works in Section 7. The second method is through explicit branch prediction. gcc recognizes __builtin_expect:

> 
>       long __builtin_expect(long EXP, long C);
>     

This construct tells the compiler that the expression EXP most likely will have the value C. The return value is EXP. __builtin_expect is meant to be used in an conditional expression. In almost all cases will it be used in the context of boolean expressions in which case it is much more convenient to define two helper macros:

> 
>       #define unlikely(expr) __builtin_expect(!!(expr), 0)
>       #define likely(expr) __builtin_expect(!!(expr), 1)
>     

These macros can then be used as in

> 
>       if (likely(a > 1))
>     

If the programmer makes use of these macros and then uses the -freorder-blocks optimization option gcc will reorder blocks as in the figure above. This option is enabled with -O2 but disabled for -Os. There is another option to reorder block (-freorder-blocks-and-partition) but it has limited usefulness because it does not work with exception handling.

There is another big advantage of small loops, at least on certain processors. The Intel Core 2 front end has a special feature called Loop Stream Detector (LSD). If a loop has no more than 18 instructions (none of which is a call to a subroutine), requires only up to 4 decoder fetches of 16 bytes, has at most 4 branch instructions, and is executed more than 64 times, than the loop is sometimes locked in the instruction queue and therefore more quickly available when the loop is used again. This applies, for instance, to small inner loops which are entered many times through an outer loop. Even without such specialized hardware compact loops have advantages.

Inlining is not the only aspect of optimization with respect to L1i. Another aspect is alignment, just as for data. There are obvious differences: code is a mostly linear blob which cannot be placed arbitrarily in the address space and it cannot be influenced directly by the programmer as the compiler generates the code. There are some aspects which the programmer can control, though.

Aligning each single instruction does not make any sense. The goal is to have the instruction stream be sequential. So alignment only makes sense in strategic places. To decide where to add alignments it is necessary to understand what the advantages can be. Having an instruction at the beginning of a cache line {_For some processors cache lines are not the atomic blocks for instructions. The Intel Core 2 front end issues 16 byte blocks to the decoder. They are appropriately aligned and so no issued block can span a cache line boundary. Aligning at the beginning of a cache line still has advantages since it optimizes the positive effects of prefetching._} means that the prefetch of the cache line is maximized. For instructions this also means the decoder is more effective. It is easy to see that, if an instruction at the end of a cache line is executed, the processor has to get ready to read a new cache line and decode the instructions. There are things which can go wrong (such as cache line misses), meaning that an instruction at the end of the cache line is, on average, not as effectively executed as one at the beginning.

Combine this with the follow-up deduction that the problem is most severe if control was just transferred to the instruction in question (and hence prefetching is not effective) and we arrive at our final conclusion where alignment of code is most useful:

  * at the beginning of functions; 
  * at the beginning of basic blocks which are reached only through jumps; 
  * to some extent, at the beginning of loops. 

In the first two cases the alignment comes at little cost. Execution proceeds at a new location and, if we choose it to be at the beginning of a cache line, we optimize prefetching and decoding. {_For instruction decoding processors often use a smaller unit than cache lines, 16 bytes in case of x86 and x86-64._} The compiler accomplishes this alignment through the insertion of a series of no-op instructions to fill the gap created by aligning the code. This "dead code" takes a little space but does not normally hurt performance.

The third case is slightly different: aligning beginning of each loop might create performance problems. The problem is that beginning of a loop often follows other code sequentially. If the circumstances are not very lucky there will be a gap between the previous instruction and the aligned beginning of the loop. Unlike in the previous two cases, this gap cannot be completely dead. After execution of the previous instruction the first instruction in the loop must be executed. This means that, following the previous instruction, there either must be a number of no-op instructions to fill the gap or there must be an unconditional jump to the beginning of the loop. Neither possibility is free. Especially if the loop itself is not executed often, the no-ops or the jump might cost more than one saves by aligning the loop.

There are three ways the programmer can influence the alignment of code. Obviously, if the code is written in assembler the function and all instructions in it can be explicitly aligned. The assembler provides for all architectures the .align pseudo-op to do that. For high-level languages the compiler must be told about alignment requirements. Unlike for data types and variables this is not possible in the source code. Instead a compiler option is used:

> 
>       -falign-functions=N
>     

This option instructs the compiler to align all functions to the next power-of-two boundary greater than N. That means a gap of up to N bytes is created. For small functions using a large value for N is a waste. Equally for code which is executed only rarely. The latter can happen a lot in libraries which can contain both popular and not-so-popular interfaces. A wise choice of the option value can speed things up or save memory by avoiding alignment. All alignment is turned off by using one as the value of N or by using the -fno-align-functions option.

The alignment for the second case above--beginning of basic blocks which are not reached sequentially--can be controlled with a different option:

> 
>       -falign-jumps=N
>     

All the other details are equivalent, the same warning about waste of memory applies.

The third case also has its own option:

> 
>       -falign-loops=N
>     

Yet again, the same details and warnings apply. Except that here, as explained before, alignment comes at a runtime cost since either no-ops or a jump instruction has to be executed if the aligned address is reached sequentially.

gcc knows about one more option for controlling alignment which is mentioned here only for completeness. -falign-labels aligns every single label in the code (basically the beginning of each basic block). This, in all but a few exceptional cases, slows down the code and therefore should not be used.

**6.2.3 Optimizing Level 2 and Higher Cache Access**

Everything said about optimizations for using level 1 cache also applies to level 2 and higher cache accesses. There are two additional aspects of last level caches:

  * cache misses are always very expensive. While L1 misses (hopefully) frequently hit L2 and higher cache, thus limiting the penalties, there is obviously no fallback for the last level cache. 
  * L2 caches and higher are often shared by multiple cores and/or hyper-threads. The effective cache size available to each execution unit is therefore usually less than the total cache size. 

To avoid the high costs of cache misses, the working set size should be matched to the cache size. If data is only needed once this obviously is not necessary since the cache would be ineffective anyway. We are talking about workloads where the data set is needed more than once. In such a case the use of a working set which is too large to fit into the cache will create large amounts of cache misses which, even with prefetching being performed successfully, will slow down the program.

A program has to perform its job even if the data set is too large. It is the programmer's job to do the work in a way which minimizes cache misses. For last-level caches this is possible--just as for L1 caches--by working on the job in smaller pieces. This is very similar to the optimized matrix multiplication on Table 6.2. One difference, though, is that, for last level caches, the data blocks which are be worked on can be bigger. The code becomes yet more complicated if L1 optimizations are needed, too. Imagine a matrix multiplication where the data sets--the two input matrices and the output matrix--do not fit into the last level cache together. In this case it might be appropriate to optimize the L1 and last level cache accesses at the same time.

The L1 cache line size is usually constant over many processor generations; even if it is not, the differences will be small. It is no big problem to just assume the larger size. On processors with smaller cache sizes two or more cache lines will then be used instead of one. In any case, it is reasonable to hardcode the cache line size and optimize the code for it.

For higher level caches this is not the case if the program is supposed to be generic. The sizes of those caches can vary widely. Factors of eight or more are not uncommon. It is not possible to assume the larger cache size as a default since this would mean the code performs poorly on all machines except those with the biggest cache. The opposite choice is bad too: assuming the smallest cache means throwing away 87% of the cache or more. This is bad; as we can see from Figure 3.14 using large caches can have a huge impact on the program's speed.

What this means is that the code must dynamically adjust itself to the cache line size. This is an optimization specific to the program. All we can say here is that the programmer should compute the program's requirements correctly. Not only are the data sets themselves needed, the higher level caches are also used for other purposes; for example, all the executed instructions are loaded from cache. If library functions are used this cache usage might add up to a significant amount. Those library functions might also need data of their own which further reduces the available memory.

Once we have a formula for the memory requirement we can compare it with the cache size. As mentioned before, the cache might be shared with multiple other cores. Currently {_There definitely will sometime soon be a better way!_} the only way to get correct information without hardcoding knowledge is through the /sys filesystem. In Table 5.2 we have seen the what the kernel publishes about the hardware. A program has to find the directory:

> 
>     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache
>     

for the last level cache. This can be recognized by the highest numeric value in the level file in that directory. When the directory is identified the program should read the content of the size file in that directory and divide the numeric value by the number of bits set in the bitmask in the file shared_cpu_map.

The value which is computed this way is a safe lower limit. Sometimes a program knows a bit more about the behavior of other threads or processes. If those threads are scheduled on a core or hyper-thread sharing the cache, and the cache usage is known to not exhaust its fraction of the total cache size, then the computed limit might be too low to be optimal. Whether more than the fair share should be used really depends on the situation. The programmer has to make a choice or has to allow the user to make a decision.

**6.2.4 Optimizing TLB Usage**

There are two kinds of optimization of TLB usage. The first optimization is to reduce the number of pages a program has to use. This automatically results in fewer TLB misses. The second optimization is to make the TLB lookup cheaper by reducing the number higher level directory tables which must be allocated. Fewer tables means less memory usage which can result is higher cache hit rates for the directory lookup.

The first optimization is closely related to the minimization of page faults. We will cover that topic in detail in Section 7.5. While page faults usually are a one-time cost, TLB misses are a perpetual penalty given that the TLB cache is usually small and it is flushed frequently. Page faults are orders of magnitude more expensive than TLB misses but, if a program is running long enough and certain parts of the program are executed frequently enough, TLB misses can outweigh even page fault costs. It is therefore important to regard page optimization not only from the perspective of page faults but also from the TLB miss perspective. The difference is that, while page fault optimizations only require page-wide grouping of the code and data, TLB optimization requires that, at any point in time, as few TLB entries are in use as possible.

The second TLB optimization is even harder to control. The number of page directories which have to be used depends on the distribution of the address ranges used in the virtual address space of the process. Widely varying locations in the address space mean more directories. A complication is that Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) leads to exactly these situations. The load addresses of stack, DSOs, heap, and possibly executable are randomized at runtime to prevent attackers of the machine from guessing the addresses of functions or variables.

For maximum performance ASLR certainly should be turned off. The costs of the extra directories is low enough, though, to make this step unnecessary in all but a few extreme cases. One possible optimization the kernel could at any time perform is to ensure that a single mapping does not cross the address space boundary between two directories. This would limit ASLR in a minimal fashion but not enough to substantially weaken it.

The only way a programmer is directly affected by this is when an address space region is explicitly requested. This happens when using mmap with MAP_FIXED. Allocating new a address space region this way is very dangerous and hardly ever done. It is possible, though, and, if it is used, the programmer should know about the boundaries of the last level page directory and select the requested address appropriately.

### 6.3 Prefetching

The purpose of prefetching is to hide the latency of a memory access. The command pipeline and out-of-order (OOO) execution capabilities of today's processors can hide some latency but, at best, only for accesses which hit the caches. To cover the latency of main memory accesses, the command queue would have to be incredibly long. Some processors without OOO try to compensate by increasing the number of cores, but this is a bad trade unless all the code in use is parallelized.

Prefetching can further help to hide latency. The processor performs prefetching on its own, triggered by certain events (hardware prefetching) or explicitly requested by the program (software prefetching).

**6.3.1 Hardware Prefetching**

The trigger for hardware prefetching is usually a sequence of two or more cache misses in a certain pattern. These cache misses can be to succeeding or preceding cache lines. In old implementations only cache misses to adjacent cache lines are recognized. With contemporary hardware, strides are recognized as well, meaning that skipping a fixed number of cache lines is recognized as a pattern and handled appropriately.

It would be bad for performance if every single cache miss triggered a hardware prefetch. Random memory accesses, for instance to global variables, are quite common and the resulting prefetches would mostly waste FSB bandwidth. This is why, to kickstart prefetching, at least two cache misses are needed. Processors today all expect there to be more than one stream of memory accesses. The processor tries to automatically assign each cache miss to such a stream and, if the threshold is reached, start hardware prefetching. CPUs today can keep track of eight to sixteen separate streams for the higher level caches.

The units responsible for the pattern recognition are associated with the respective cache. There can be a prefetch unit for the L1d and L1i caches. There is most probably a prefetch unit for the L2 cache and higher. The L2 and higher prefetch unit is shared with all the other cores and hyper-threads using the same cache. The number of eight to sixteen separate streams therefore is quickly reduced.

Prefetching has one big weakness: it cannot cross page boundaries. The reason should be obvious when one realizes that the CPUs support demand paging. If the prefetcher were allowed to cross page boundaries, the access might trigger an OS event to make the page available. This by itself can be bad, especially for performance. What is worse is that the prefetcher does not know about the semantics of the program or the OS itself. It might therefore prefetch pages which, in real life, never would be requested. That means the prefetcher would run past the end of the memory region the processor accessed in a recognizable pattern before. This is not only possible, it is very likely. If the processor, as a side effect of a prefetch, triggered a request for such a page the OS might even be completely thrown off its tracks if such a request could never otherwise happen.

It is therefore important to realize that, regardless of how good the prefetcher is at predicting the pattern, the program will experience cache misses at page boundaries unless it explicitly prefetches or reads from the new page. This is another reason to optimize the layout of data as described in Section 6.2 to minimize cache pollution by keeping unrelated data out.

Because of this page limitation the processors do not have terribly sophisticated logic to recognize prefetch patterns. With the still predominant 4k page size there is only so much which makes sense. The address range in which strides are recognized has been increased over the years, but it probably does not make much sense to go beyond the 512 byte window which is often used today. Currently prefetch units do not recognize non-linear access patterns. It is more likely than not that such patterns are truly random or, at least, sufficiently non-repeating that it makes no sense to try recognizing them.

If hardware prefetching is accidentally triggered there is only so much one can do. One possibility is to try to detect this problem and change the data and/or code layout a bit. This is likely to prove hard. There might be special localized solutions like using the ud2 instruction {_Or non-instruction. It is the recommended undefined opcode._} on x86 and x86-64 processors. This instruction, which cannot be executed itself, is used after an indirect jump instruction; it is used as a signal to the instruction fetcher that the processor should not waste efforts decoding the following memory since the execution will continue at a different location. This is a very special situation, though. In most cases one has to live with this problem.

It is possible to completely or partially disable hardware prefetching for the entire processor. On Intel processors an Model Specific Register (MSR) is used for this (IA32_MISC_ENABLE, bit 9 on many processors; bit 19 disables only the adjacent cache line prefetch). This, in most cases, has to happen in the kernel since it is a privileged operation. If profiling shows that an important application running on a system suffers from bandwidth exhaustion and premature cache evictions due to hardware prefetches, using this MSR is a possibility.

**6.3.2 Software Prefetching**

The advantage of hardware prefetching is that programs do not have to be adjusted. The drawbacks, as just described, are that the access patterns must be trivial and that prefetching cannot happen across page boundaries. For these reasons we now have more possibilities, software prefetching the most important of them. Software prefetching does require modification of the source code by inserting special instructions. Some compilers support pragmas to more or less automatically insert prefetch instructions. On x86 and x86-64 Intel's convention for compiler intrinsics to insert these special instructions is generally used:

> 
>     #include <xmmintrin.h>
>     enum _mm_hint
>     {
>       _MM_HINT_T0 = 3,
>       _MM_HINT_T1 = 2,
>       _MM_HINT_T2 = 1,
>       _MM_HINT_NTA = 0
>     };
>     void _mm_prefetch(void *p,
>                       enum _mm_hint h);
>     

Programs can use the _mm_prefetch intrinsic on any pointer in the program. Most processors (certainly all x86 and x86-64 processors) ignore errors resulting from invalid pointers which make the life of the programmer significantly easier. If the passed pointer references valid memory, though, the prefetch unit will be instructed to load the data into cache and, if necessary, evict other data. Unnecessary prefetches should definitely be avoided since this might reduce the effectiveness of the caches and it consumes memory bandwidth (possibly for two cache lines in case the evicted cache line is dirty).

The different hints to be used with the _mm_prefetch intrinsic are implementation defined. That means each processor version can implement them (slightly) differently. What can generally be said is that _MM_HINT_T0 fetches data to all levels of the cache for inclusive caches and to the lowest level cache for exclusive caches. If the data item is in a higher level cache it is loaded into L1d. The _MM_HINT_T1 hint pulls the data into L2 and not into L1d. If there is an L3 cache the _MM_HINT_T2 hints can do something similar for it. These are details, though, which are weakly specified and need to be verified for the actual processor in use. In general, if the data is to be used right away using _MM_HINT_T0 is the right thing to do. Of course this requires that the L1d cache size is large enough to hold all the prefetched data. If the size of the immediately used working set is too large, prefetching everything into L1d is a bad idea and the other two hints should be used.

The fourth hint, _MM_HINT_NTA, is special in that it allows telling the processor to treat the prefetched cache line specially. NTA stands for non-temporal aligned which we already explained in Section 6.1. The program tells the processor that polluting caches with this data should be avoided as much as possible since the data is only used for a short time. The processor can therefore, upon loading, avoid reading the data into the lower level caches for inclusive cache implementations. When the data is evicted from L1d the data need not be pushed into L2 or higher but, instead, can be written directly to memory. There might be other tricks the processor designers can deploy if this hint is given. The programmer must be careful using this hint: if the immediate working set size is too large and forces eviction of a cache line loaded with the NTA hint, reloading from memory will occur.

> > _Figure 6.7: Average with Prefetch, NPAD=31_

Figure 6.7 shows the results of a test using the now familiar pointer chasing framework. The list is randomized. The difference to previous test is that the program actually spends some time at each list node (about 160 cycles). As we learned from the data in Figure 3.15, the program's performance suffers badly as soon as the working set size is larger than the last-level cache.

We can now try to improve the situation by issuing prefetch requests ahead of the computation. I.e., in each round of the loop we prefetch a new element. The distance between the prefetched node in the list and the node which is currently worked on must be carefully chosen. Given that each node is processed in 160 cycles and that we have to prefetch two cache lines (NPAD=31), a distance of five list elements is enough.

The results in Figure 6.7 show that the prefetch does indeed help. As long as the working set size does not exceed the size of the last level cache (the machine has 512kB = 219B of L2) the numbers are identical. The prefetch instructions do not add a measurable extra burden. As soon as the L2 size is exceeded the prefetching saves between 50 to 60 cycles, up to 8%. The use of prefetch cannot hide all the penalties but it does help a bit.

AMD implements, in their family 10h of the Opteron line, another instruction: prefetchw. This instruction has so far no equivalent on the Intel side and is not available through intrinsics. The prefetchw instruction prefetches the cache line into L1 just like the other prefetch instructions. The difference is that the cache line is immediately put into 'M' state. This will be a disadvantage if no write to the cache line follows later. If there are one or more writes, they will be accelerated since the writes do not have to change the cache state--that already happened when the cache line was prefetched.

Prefetching can have bigger advantages than the meager 8% we achieved here. But it is notoriously hard to do right, especially if the same binary is supposed to perform well on a variety of machines. The performance counters provided by the CPU can help the programmer analyze prefetches. Events which can be counted and sampled include hardware prefetches, software prefetches, useful software prefetches, cache misses at the various levels, and more. In Section 7.1 we will introduce a number of these events. All these counters are machine specific.

When analyzing programs one should first look at the cache misses. When a large source of cache misses is located one should try to add a prefetch instruction for the problematic memory accesses. This should be done in one place at a time. The result of each modification should be checked by observing the performance counters measuring useful prefetch instructions. If those counters do not increase the prefetch might be wrong, it is not given enough time to load from memory, or the prefetch evicts memory from the cache which is still needed.

gcc today is able to emit prefetch instructions automatically in one situation. If a loop is iterating over an array the following option can be used:

> 
>     -fprefetch-loop-arrays
>     

The compiler will figure out whether prefetching makes sense and, if so, how far ahead it should look. For small arrays this can be a disadvantage and, if the size of the array is not known at compile time, the results might be worse. The gcc manual warns that the benefits highly depend on the form of the code and that in some situation the code might actually run slower. Programmers have to use this option carefully.

**6.3.3 Special Kind of Prefetch: Speculation**

The OOO execution capability of a processor allows moving instructions around if they do not conflict with each other. For instance (using this time IA-64 for the example):

> 
>       st8        [r4] = 12
>       add        r5 = r6, r7;;
>       st8        [r18] = r5
>     

This code sequence stores 12 at the address specified by register r4, adds the content of registers r6 and r7 and stores it in register r5. Finally it stores the sum at the address specified by register r18. The point here is that the add instruction can be executed before--or at the same time as--the first st8 instruction since there is no data dependency. But what happens if one of the addends has to be loaded?

> 
>       st8        [r4] = 12
>       ld8        r6 = [r8];;
>       add        r5 = r6, r7;;
>       st8        [r18] = r5
>     

The extra ld8 instruction loads the value from the address specified by the register r8. There is an obvious data dependency between this load instruction and the following add instruction (this is the reason for the ;; after the instruction, thanks for asking). What is critical here is that the new ld8 instruction--unlike the add instruction--cannot be moved in front of the first st8. The processor cannot determine quickly enough during the instruction decoding whether the store and load conflict, i.e., whether r4 and r8 might have same value. If they do have the same value, the st8 instruction would determine the value loaded into r6. What is worse, the ld8 might also bring with it a large latency in case the load misses the caches. The IA-64 architecture supports speculative loads for this case:

> 
>       ld8.a      r6 = [r8];;
>       [... other instructions ...]
>       st8        [r4] = 12
>       ld8.c.clr  r6 = [r8];;
>       add        r5 = r6, r7;;
>       st8        [r18] = r5
>     

The new ld8.a and ld8.c.clr instructions belong together and replace the ld8 instruction in the previous code sequence. The ld8.a instruction is the speculative load. The value cannot be used directly but the processor can start the work. At the time when the ld8.c.clr instruction is reached the content might have been loaded already (given there is a sufficient number of instructions in the gap). The arguments for this instruction must match that for the ld8.a instruction. If the preceding st8 instruction does not overwrite the value (i.e., r4 and r8 are the same), nothing has to be done. The speculative load does its job and the latency of the load is hidden. If the store and load do conflict the ld8.c.clr reloads the value from memory and we end up with the semantics of a normal ld8 instruction.

Speculative loads are not (yet?) widely used. But as the example shows it is a very simple yet effective way to hide latencies. Prefetching is basically equivalent and, for processors with fewer registers, speculative loads probably do not make much sense. Speculative loads have the (sometimes big) advantage of loading the value directly into the register and not into the cache line where it might be evicted again (for instance, when the thread is descheduled). If speculation is available it should be used.

**6.3.4 Helper Threads**

When one tries to use software prefetching one often runs into problems with the complexity of the code. If the code has to iterate over a data structure (a list in our case) one has to implement two independent iterations in the same loop: the normal iteration doing the work and the second iteration, which looks ahead, to use prefetching. This easily gets complex enough that mistakes are likely.

Furthermore, it is necessary to determine how far to look ahead. Too little and the memory will not be loaded in time. Too far and the just loaded data might have been evicted again. Another problem is that prefetch instructions, although they do not block and wait for the memory to be loaded, take time. The instruction has to be decoded, which might be noticeable if the decoder is too busy, for instance, due to well written/generated code. Finally, the code size of the loop is increased. This decreases the L1i efficiency. If one tries to avoid parts of this cost by issuing multiple prefetch requests in a row (in case the second load does not depend on the result of the first) one runs into problems with the number of outstanding prefetch requests.

An alternative approach is to perform the normal operation and the prefetch completely separately. This can happen using two normal threads. The threads must obviously be scheduled so that the prefetch thread is populating a cache accessed by both threads. There are two special solutions worth mentioning:

  * Use hyper-threads (see Figure 3.22) on the same core. In this case the prefetch can go into L2 (or even L1d). 
  * Use "dumber" threads than SMT threads which can do nothing but prefetch and other simple operations. This is an option processor manufacturers might explore. 

The use of hyper-threads is particularly intriguing. As we have seen on Figure 3.22, the sharing of caches is a problem if the hyper-threads execute independent code. If, instead, one thread is used as a prefetch helper thread this is not a problem. To the contrary, it is the desired effect since the lowest level cache is preloaded. Furthermore, since the prefetch thread is mostly idle or waiting for memory, the normal operation of the other hyper-thread is not disturbed much if it does not have to access main memory itself. The latter is exactly what the prefetch helper thread prevents.

The only tricky part is to ensure that the helper thread is not running too far ahead. It must not completely pollute the cache so that the oldest prefetched values are evicted again. On Linux, synchronization is easily done using the futex system call [futexes] or, at a little bit higher cost, using the POSIX thread synchronization primitives.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.53.png)
> 
> > _Figure 6.8: Average with Helper Thread, NPAD=31_

The benefits of the approach can be seen in Figure 6.8. This is the same test as in Figure 6.7 only with the additional result added. The new test creates an additional helper thread which runs about 100 list entries ahead and reads (not only prefetches) all the cache lines of each list element. In this case we have two cache lines per list element (NPAD=31 on a 32-bit machine with 64 byte cache line size).

The two threads are scheduled on two hyper-threads of the same core. The test machine has only one core but the results should be about the same if there is more than one core. The affinity functions, which we will introduce in Section 6.4.3, are used to tie the threads down to the appropriate hyper-thread.

To determine which two (or more) processors the OS knows are hyper-threads, the NUMA_cpu_level_mask interface from libNUMA can be used (see Section 12).

> 
>     #include <libNUMA.h>
>     ssize_t NUMA_cpu_level_mask(size_t destsize,
>                                 cpu_set_t *dest,
>                                 size_t srcsize,
>                                 const cpu_set_t*src,
>                                 unsigned int level);
>     

This interface can be used to determine the hierarchy of CPUs as they are connected through caches and memory. Of interest here is level 1 which corresponds to hyper-threads. To schedule two threads on two hyper-threads the libNUMA functions can be used (error handling dropped for brevity):

> 
>       cpu_set_t self;
>       NUMA_cpu_self_current_mask(sizeof(self),
>                                  &self);
>       cpu_set_t hts;
>       NUMA_cpu_level_mask(sizeof(hts), &hts,
>                           sizeof(self), &self, 1);
>       CPU_XOR(&hts, &hts, &self);
>     

After this code is executed we have two CPU bit sets. self can be used to set the affinity of the current thread and the mask in hts can be used to set the affinity of the helper thread. This should ideally happen before the thread is created. In Section 6.4.3 we will introduce the interface to set the affinity. If there is no hyper-thread available the NUMA_cpu_level_mask function will return 1. This can be used as a sign to avoid this optimization.

The result of this benchmark might be surprising (or maybe not). If the working set fits into L2, the overhead of the helper thread reduces the performance by between 10% and 60% (ignore the smallest working set sizes again, the noise is too high). This should be expected since, if all the data is already in the L2 cache, the prefetch helper thread only uses system resources without contributing to the execution.

Once the L2 size is exhausted the picture changes, though. The prefetch helper thread helps to reduce the runtime by about 25%. We still see a rising curve simply because the prefetches cannot be processed fast enough. The arithmetic operations performed by the main thread and the memory load operations of the helper thread do complement each other, though. The resource collisions are minimal which causes this synergistic effect.

The results of this test should be transferable to many other situations. Hyper-threads, often not useful due to cache pollution, shine in these situations and should be taken advantage of. The sys file system allows a program to find the thread siblings (see the thread_siblings column in Table 5.3). Once this information is available the program just has to define the affinity of the threads and then run the loop in two modes: normal operation and prefetching. The amount of memory prefetched should depend on the size of the shared cache. In this example the L2 size is relevant and the program can query the size using

> 
>         sysconf(_SC_LEVEL2_CACHE_SIZE)
>     

Whether or not the progress of the helper thread must be restricted depends on the program. In general it is best to make sure there is some synchronization since scheduling details could otherwise cause significant performance degradations.

**6.3.5 Direct Cache Access**

One sources of cache misses in a modern OS is the handling of incoming data traffic. Modern hardware, like Network Interface Cards (NICs) and disk controllers, has the ability to write the received or read data directly into memory without involving the CPU. This is crucial for the performance of the devices we have today, but it also causes problems. Assume an incoming packet from a network: the OS has to decide how to handle it by looking at the header of the packet. The NIC places the packet into memory and then notifies the processor about the arrival. The processor has no chance to prefetch the data since it does not know when the data will arrive, and maybe not even where exactly it will be stored. The result is a cache miss when reading the header.

Intel has added technology in their chipsets and CPUs to alleviate this problem [directcacheaccess]. The idea is to populate the cache of the CPU which will be notified about the incoming packet with the packet's data. The payload of the packet is not critical here, this data will, in general, be handled by higher-level functions, either in the kernel or at user level. The packet header is used to make decisions about the way the packet has to be handled and so this data is needed immediately.

The network I/O hardware already has DMA to write the packet. That means it communicates directly with the memory controller which potentially is integrated in the Northbridge. Another side of the memory controller is the interface to the processors through the FSB (assuming the memory controller is not integrated into the CPU itself).

The idea behind Direct Cache Access (DCA) is to extend the protocol between the NIC and the memory controller. In Figure 6.9 the first figure shows the beginning of the DMA transfer in a regular machine with North- and Southbridge.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.55.png)
> 
> > _DMA and DCA Executed_
> 
> **Figure 6.9: Direct Cache Access**

The NIC is connected to (or is part of) the Southbridge. It initiates the DMA access but provides the new information about the packet header which should be pushed into the processor's cache.

The traditional behavior would be, in step two, to simply complete the DMA transfer with the connection to the memory. For the DMA transfers with the DCA flag set the Northbridge additionally sends the data on the FSB with a special, new DCA flag. The processor always snoops the FSB and, if it recognizes the DCA flag, it tries to load the data directed to the processor into the lowest cache. The DCA flag is, in fact, a hint; the processor can freely ignore it. After the DMA transfer is finished the processor is signaled.

The OS, when processing the packet, first has to determine what kind of packet it is. If the DCA hint is not ignored, the loads the OS has to perform to identify the packet most likely hit the cache. Multiply this saving of hundreds of cycles per packet with tens of thousands of packets which can be processed per second, and the savings add up to very significant numbers, especially when it comes to latency.

Without the integration of I/O hardware (NIC in this case), chipset, and CPUs such an optimization is not possible. It is therefore necessary to make sure to select the platform wisely if this technology is needed.

CPUs are today much more sophisticated than they were only 25 years ago. In those days, the frequency of the CPU core was at a level equivalent to that of the memory bus. Memory access was only a bit slower than register access. But this changed dramatically in the early 90s, when CPU designers increased the frequency of the CPU core but the frequency of the memory bus and the performance of RAM chips did not increase proportionally. This is not due to the fact that faster RAM could not be built, as explained in the previous section. It is possible but it is not economical. RAM as fast as current CPU cores is orders of magnitude more expensive than any dynamic RAM.

If the choice is between a machine with very little, very fast RAM and a machine with a lot of relatively fast RAM, the second will always win given a working set size which exceeds the small RAM size and the cost of accessing secondary storage media such as hard drives. The problem here is the speed of secondary storage, usually hard disks, which must be used to hold the swapped out part of the working set. Accessing those disks is orders of magnitude slower than even DRAM access.

Fortunately it does not have to be an all-or-nothing decision. A computer can have a small amount of high-speed SRAM in addition to the large amount of DRAM. One possible implementation would be to dedicate a certain area of the address space of the processor as containing the SRAM and the rest the DRAM. The task of the operating system would then be to optimally distribute data to make use of the SRAM. Basically, the SRAM serves in this situation as an extension of the register set of the processor.

While this is a possible implementation, it is not viable. Ignoring the problem of mapping the physical resources of such SRAM-backed memory to the virtual address spaces of the processes (which by itself is terribly hard) this approach would require each process to administer in software the allocation of this memory region. The size of the memory region can vary from processor to processor (i.e., processors have different amounts of the expensive SRAM-backed memory). Each module which makes up part of a program will claim its share of the fast memory, which introduces additional costs through synchronization requirements. In short, the gains of having fast memory would be eaten up completely by the overhead of administering the resources.

So, instead of putting the SRAM under the control of the OS or user, it becomes a resource which is transparently used and administered by the processors. In this mode, SRAM is used to make temporary copies of (to cache, in other words) data in main memory which is likely to be used soon by the processor. This is possible because program code and data has temporal and spatial locality. This means that, over short periods of time, there is a good chance that the same code or data gets reused. For code this means that there are most likely loops in the code so that the same code gets executed over and over again (the perfect case for _spatial locality_). Data accesses are also ideally limited to small regions. Even if the memory used over short time periods is not close together there is a high chance that the same data will be reused before long (_temporal locality_). For code this means, for instance, that in a loop a function call is made and that function is located elsewhere in the address space. The function may be distant in memory, but calls to that function will be close in time. For data it means that the total amount of memory used at one time (the working set size) is ideally limited but the memory used, as a result of the _random_ access nature of RAM, is not close together. Realizing that locality exists is key to the concept of CPU caches as we use them today.

A simple computation can show how effective caches can theoretically be. Assume access to main memory takes 200 cycles and access to the cache memory take 15 cycles. Then code using 100 data elements 100 times each will spend 2,000,000 cycles on memory operations if there is no cache and only 168,500 cycles if all data can be cached. That is an improvement of 91.5%.

The size of the SRAM used for caches is many times smaller than the main memory. In the author's experience with workstations with CPU caches the cache size has always been around 1/1000th of the size of the main memory (today: 4MB cache and 4GB main memory). This alone does not constitute a problem. If the size of the working set (the set of data currently worked on) is smaller than the cache size it does not matter. But computers do not have large main memories for no reason. The working set is bound to be larger than the cache. This is especially true for systems running multiple processes where the size of the working set is the sum of the sizes of all the individual processes and the kernel.

What is needed to deal with the limited size of the cache is a set of good strategies to determine what should be cached at any given time. Since not all data of the working set is used at _exactly_ the same time we can use techniques to temporarily replace some data in the cache with other data. And maybe this can be done before the data is actually needed. This prefetching would remove some of the costs of accessing main memory since it happens asynchronously with respect to the execution of the program. All these techniques and more can be used to make the cache appear bigger than it actually is. We will discuss them in Section 3.3. Once all these techniques are exploited it is up to the programmer to help the processor. How this can be done will be discussed in Section 6.

### 3.1 CPU Caches in the Big Picture

Before diving into technical details of the implementation of CPU caches some readers might find it useful to first see in some more details how caches fit into the "big picture" of a modern computer system.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.1.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.1: Minimum Cache Configuration_

Figure 3.1 shows the minimum cache configuration. It corresponds to the architecture which could be found in early systems which deployed CPU caches. The CPU core is no longer directly connected to the main memory. {_In even earlier systems the cache was attached to the system bus just like the CPU and the main memory. This was more a hack than a real solution._} All loads and stores have to go through the cache. The connection between the CPU core and the cache is a special, fast connection. In a simplified representation, the main memory and the cache are connected to the system bus which can also be used for communication with other components of the system. We introduced the system bus as "FSB" which is the name in use today; see Section 2.2. In this section we ignore the Northbridge; it is assumed to be present to facilitate the communication of the CPU(s) with the main memory.

Even though computers for the last several decades have used the von Neumann architecture, experience has shown that it is of advantage to separate the caches used for code and for data. Intel has used separate code and data caches since 1993 and never looked back. The memory regions needed for code and data are pretty much independent of each other, which is why independent caches work better. In recent years another advantage emerged: the instruction decoding step for the most common processors is slow; caching decoded instructions can speed up the execution, especially when the pipeline is empty due to incorrectly predicted or impossible-to-predict branches.

Soon after the introduction of the cache, the system got more complicated. The speed difference between the cache and the main memory increased again, to a point that another level of cache was added, bigger and slower than the first-level cache. Only increasing the size of the first-level cache was not an option for economical reasons. Today, there are even machines with three levels of cache in regular use. A system with such a processor looks like Figure 3.2. With the increase on the number of cores in a single CPU the number of cache levels might increase in the future even more.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.2.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.2: Processor with Level 3 Cache_

Figure 3.2 shows three levels of cache and introduces the nomenclature we will use in the remainder of the document. L1d is the level 1 data cache, L1i the level 1 instruction cache, etc. Note that this is a schematic; the data flow in reality need not pass through any of the higher-level caches on the way from the core to the main memory. CPU designers have a lot of freedom designing the interfaces of the caches. For programmers these design choices are invisible.

In addition we have processors which have multiple cores and each core can have multiple "threads". The difference between a core and a thread is that separate cores have separate copies of (almost {_Early multi-core processors even had separate 2nd level caches and no 3rd level cache._}) all the hardware resources. The cores can run completely independently unless they are using the same resources--e.g., the connections to the outside--at the same time. Threads, on the other hand, share almost all of the processor's resources. Intel's implementation of threads has only separate registers for the threads and even that is limited, some registers are shared. The complete picture for a modern CPU therefore looks like Figure 3.3.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.3.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.3: Multi processor, multi-core, multi-thread_

In this figure we have two processors, each with two cores, each of which has two threads. The threads share the Level 1 caches. The cores (shaded in the darker gray) have individual Level 1 caches. All cores of the CPU share the higher-level caches. The two processors (the two big boxes shaded in the lighter gray) of course do not share any caches. All this will be important, especially when we are discussing the cache effects on multi-process and multi-thread applications.

### 3.2 Cache Operation at High Level

To understand the costs and savings of using a cache we have to combine the knowledge about the machine architecture and RAM technology from Section 2 with the structure of caches described in the previous section.

By default all data read or written by the CPU cores is stored in the cache. There are memory regions which cannot be cached but this is something only the OS implementers have to be concerned about; it is not visible to the application programmer. There are also instructions which allow the programmer to deliberately bypass certain caches. This will be discussed in Section 6.

If the CPU needs a data word the caches are searched first. Obviously, the cache cannot contain the content of the entire main memory (otherwise we would need no cache), but since all memory addresses are cacheable, each cache entry is _tagged_ using the address of the data word in the main memory. This way a request to read or write to an address can search the caches for a matching tag. The address in this context can be either the virtual or physical address, varying based on the cache implementation.

Since the tag requires space in addition to the actual memory, it is inefficient to chose a word as the granularity of the cache. For a 32-bit word on an x86 machine the tag itself might need 32 bits or more. Furthermore, since spatial locality is one of the principles on which caches are based, it would be bad to not take this into account. Since neighboring memory is likely to be used together it should also be loaded into the cache together. Remember also what we learned in Section 2.2.1: RAM modules are much more effective if they can transport many data words in a row without a new CAS or even RAS signal. So the entries stored in the caches are not single words but, instead, "lines" of several contiguous words. In early caches these lines were 32 bytes long; now the norm is 64 bytes. If the memory bus is 64 bits wide this means 8 transfers per cache line. DDR supports this transport mode efficiently.

When memory content is needed by the processor the entire cache line is loaded into the L1d. The memory address for each cache line is computed by masking the address value according to the cache line size. For a 64 byte cache line this means the low 6 bits are zeroed. The discarded bits are used as the offset into the cache line. The remaining bits are in some cases used to locate the line in the cache and as the tag. In practice an address value is split into three parts. For a 32-bit address it might look as follows:

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.12.png)

With a cache line size of 2O the low O bits are used as the offset into the cache line. The next S bits select the "cache set". We will go into more detail soon on why sets, and not single slots, are used for cache lines. For now it is sufficient to understand there are 2S sets of cache lines. This leaves the top 32 - S - O = T bits which form the tag. These T bits are the value associated with each cache line to distinguish all the _aliases_ {_All cache lines with the same S part of the address are known by the same alias._} which are cached in the same cache set. The S bits used to address the cache set do not have to be stored since they are the same for all cache lines in the same set.

When an instruction modifies memory the processor still has to load a cache line first because no instruction modifies an entire cache line at once (exception to the rule: write-combining as explained in Section 6.1). The content of the cache line before the write operation therefore has to be loaded. It is not possible for a cache to hold partial cache lines. A cache line which has been written to and which has not been written back to main memory is said to be "dirty". Once it is written the dirty flag is cleared.

To be able to load new data in a cache it is almost always first necessary to make room in the cache. An eviction from L1d pushes the cache line down into L2 (which uses the same cache line size). This of course means room has to be made in L2. This in turn might push the content into L3 and ultimately into main memory. Each eviction is progressively more expensive. What is described here is the model for an _exclusive cache_ as is preferred by modern AMD and VIA processors. Intel implements _inclusive caches_ {_This generalization is not completely correct. A few caches are exclusive and some inclusive caches have exclusive cache properties._} where each cache line in L1d is also present in L2. Therefore evicting from L1d is much faster. With enough L2 cache the disadvantage of wasting memory for content held in two places is minimal and it pays off when evicting. A possible advantage of an exclusive cache is that loading a new cache line only has to touch the L1d and not the L2, which could be faster.

The CPUs are allowed to manage the caches as they like as long as the memory model defined for the processor architecture is not changed. It is, for instance, perfectly fine for a processor to take advantage of little or no memory bus activity and proactively write dirty cache lines back to main memory. The wide variety of cache architectures among the processors for the x86 and x86-64, between manufacturers and even within the models of the same manufacturer, are testament to the power of the memory model abstraction.

In symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems the caches of the CPUs cannot work independently from each other. All processors are supposed to see the same memory content at all times. The maintenance of this uniform view of memory is called "cache coherency". If a processor were to look simply at its own caches and main memory it would not see the content of dirty cache lines in other processors. Providing direct access to the caches of one processor from another processor would be terribly expensive and a huge bottleneck. Instead, processors detect when another processor wants to read or write to a certain cache line.

If a write access is detected and the processor has a clean copy of the cache line in its cache, this cache line is marked invalid. Future references will require the cache line to be reloaded. Note that a read access on another CPU does not necessitate an invalidation, multiple clean copies can very well be kept around.

More sophisticated cache implementations allow another possibility to happen. If the cache line which another processor wants to read from or write to is currently marked dirty in the first processor's cache a different course of action is needed. In this case the main memory is out-of-date and the requesting processor must, instead, get the cache line content from the first processor. Through snooping, the first processor notices this situation and automatically sends the requesting processor the data. This action bypasses main memory, though in some implementations the memory controller is supposed to notice this direct transfer and store the updated cache line content in main memory. If the access is for writing the first processor then invalidates its copy of the local cache line.

Over time a number of cache coherency protocols have been developed. The most important is MESI, which we will introduce in Section 3.3.4. The outcome of all this can be summarized in a few simple rules:

  * A dirty cache line is not present in any other processor's cache. 
  * Clean copies of the same cache line can reside in arbitrarily many caches. 

If these rules can be maintained, processors can use their caches efficiently even in multi-processor systems. All the processors need to do is to monitor each others' write accesses and compare the addresses with those in their local caches. In the next section we will go into a few more details about the implementation and especially the costs.

Finally, we should at least give an impression of the costs associated with cache hits and misses. These are the numbers Intel lists for a Pentium M:

These are the actual access times measured in CPU cycles. It is interesting to note that for the on-die L2 cache a large part (probably even the majority) of the access time is caused by wire delays. This is a physical limitation which can only get worse with increasing cache sizes. Only process shrinking (for instance, going from 60nm for Merom to 45nm for Penryn in Intel's lineup) can improve those numbers.

The numbers in the table look high but, fortunately, the entire cost does not have to be paid for each occurrence of the cache load and miss. Some parts of the cost can be hidden. Today's processors all use internal pipelines of different lengths where the instructions are decoded and prepared for execution. Part of the preparation is loading values from memory (or cache) if they are transferred to a register. If the memory load operation can be started early enough in the pipeline, it may happen in parallel with other operations and the entire cost of the load might be hidden. This is often possible for L1d; for some processors with long pipelines for L2 as well.

There are many obstacles to starting the memory read early. It might be as simple as not having sufficient resources for the memory access or it might be that the final address of the load becomes available late as the result of another instruction. In these cases the load costs cannot be hidden (completely).

For write operations the CPU does not necessarily have to wait until the value is safely stored in memory. As long as the execution of the following instructions appears to have the same effect as if the value were stored in memory there is nothing which prevents the CPU from taking shortcuts. It can start executing the next instruction early. With the help of shadow registers which can hold values no longer available in a regular register it is even possible to change the value which is to be stored in the incomplete write operation.

> 
> > _Figure 3.4: Access Times for Random Writes_

For an illustration of the effects of cache behavior see Figure 3.4. We will talk about the program which generated the data later; it is a simple simulation of a program which accesses a configurable amount of memory repeatedly in a random fashion. Each data item has a fixed size. The number of elements depends on the selected working set size. The Y-axis shows the average number of CPU cycles it takes to process one element; note that the scale for the Y-axis is logarithmic. The same applies in all the diagrams of this kind to the X-axis. The size of the working set is always shown in powers of two.

The graph shows three distinct plateaus. This is not surprising: the specific processor has L1d and L2 caches, but no L3. With some experience we can deduce that the L1d is 213 bytes in size and that the L2 is 220 bytes in size. If the entire working set fits into the L1d the cycles per operation on each element is below 10. Once the L1d size is exceeded the processor has to load data from L2 and the average time springs up to around 28. Once the L2 is not sufficient anymore the times jump to 480 cycles and more. This is when many or most operations have to load data from main memory. And worse: since data is being modified dirty cache lines have to be written back, too.

This graph should give sufficient motivation to look into coding improvements which help improve cache usage. We are not talking about a few measly percent here; we are talking about orders-of-magnitude improvements which are sometimes possible. In Section 6 we will discuss techniques which allow writing more efficient code. The next section goes into more details of CPU cache designs. The knowledge is good to have but not necessary for the rest of the paper. So this section could be skipped.

### 3.3 CPU Cache Implementation Details

Cache implementers have the problem that each cell in the huge main memory potentially has to be cached. If the working set of a program is large enough this means there are many main memory locations which fight for each place in the cache. Previously it was noted that a ratio of 1-to-1000 for cache versus main memory size is not uncommon.

**3.3.1 Associativity**

It would be possible to implement a cache where each cache line can hold a copy of any memory location. This is called a _fully associative cache_. To access a cache line the processor core would have to compare the tags of each and every cache line with the tag for the requested address. The tag would be comprised of the entire part of the address which is not the offset into the cache line (that means, S in the figure on Section 3.2 is zero).

There are caches which are implemented like this but, by looking at the numbers for an L2 in use today, will show that this is impractical. Given a 4MB cache with 64B cache lines the cache would have 65,536 entries. To achieve adequate performance the cache logic would have to be able to pick from all these entries the one matching a given tag in just a few cycles. The effort to implement this would be enormous.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.70.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.5: Fully Associative Cache Schematics_

For each cache line a comparator is needed to compare the large tag (note, S is zero). The letter next to each connection indicates the width in bits. If none is given it is a single bit line. Each comparator has to compare two T-bit-wide values. Then, based on the result, the appropriate cache line content is selected and made available. This requires merging as many sets of O data lines as there are cache buckets. The number of transistors needed to implement a single comparator is large especially since it must work very fast. No iterative comparator is usable. The only way to save on the number of comparators is to reduce the number of them by iteratively comparing the tags. This is not suitable for the same reason that iterative comparators are not: it takes too long.

Fully associative caches are practical for small caches (for instance, the TLB caches on some Intel processors are fully associative) but those caches are small, really small. We are talking about a few dozen entries at most.

For L1i, L1d, and higher level caches a different approach is needed. What can be done is to restrict the search. In the most extreme restriction each tag maps to exactly one cache entry. The computation is simple: given the 4MB/64B cache with 65,536 entries we can directly address each entry by using bits 6 to 21 of the address (16 bits). The low 6 bits are the index into the cache line.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.71.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.6: Direct-Mapped Cache Schematics_

Such a _direct-mapped cache_ is fast and relatively easy to implement as can be seen in Figure 3.6. It requires exactly one comparator, one multiplexer (two in this diagram where tag and data are separated, but this is not a hard requirement on the design), and some logic to select only valid cache line content. The comparator is complex due to the speed requirements but there is only one of them now; as a result more effort can be spent on making it fast. The real complexity in this approach lies in the multiplexers. The number of transistors in a simple multiplexer grows with O(log N), where N is the number of cache lines. This is tolerable but might get slow, in which case speed can be increased by spending more real estate on transistors in the multiplexers to parallelize some of the work and to increase the speed. The total number of transistors can grow slowly with a growing cache size which makes this solution very attractive. But it has a drawback: it only works well if the addresses used by the program are evenly distributed with respect to the bits used for the direct mapping. If they are not, and this is usually the case, some cache entries are heavily used and therefore repeatedly evicted while others are hardly used at all or remain empty.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.73.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.7: Set-Associative Cache Schematics_

This problem can be solved by making the cache _set associative_. A set-associative cache combines the features of the full associative and direct-mapped caches to largely avoid the weaknesses of those designs. Figure 3.7 shows the design of a set-associative cache. The tag and data storage are divided into sets which are selected by the address. This is similar to the direct-mapped cache. But instead of only having one element for each set value in the cache a small number of values is cached for the same set value. The tags for all the set members are compared in parallel, which is similar to the functioning of the fully associative cache.

The result is a cache which is not easily defeated by unfortunate or deliberate selection of addresses with the same set numbers and at the same time the size of the cache is not limited by the number of comparators which can be implemented in parallel. If the cache grows it is (in this figure) only the number of columns which increases, not the number of rows. The number of rows only increases if the associativity of the cache is increased. Today processors are using associativity levels of up to 16 for L2 caches or higher. L1 caches usually get by with 8.

**Table 3.1: Effects of Cache Size, Associativity, and Line Size**

Given our 4MB/64B cache and 8-way set associativity the cache we are left with has 8,192 sets and only 13 bits of the tag are used in addressing the cache set. To determine which (if any) of the entries in the cache set contains the addressed cache line 8 tags have to be compared. That is feasible to do in very short time. With an experiment we can see that this makes sense.

Table 3.1 shows the number of L2 cache misses for a program (gcc in this case, the most important benchmark of them all, according to the Linux kernel people) for changing cache size, cache line size, and associativity set size. In Section 7.2 we will introduce the tool to simulate the caches as required for this test.

Just in case this is not yet obvious, the relationship of all these values is that the cache size is

> cache line size Ã— associativity Ã— number of sets 

The addresses are mapped into the cache by using

> **O** = log2 cache line size  
**S** = log2 number of sets 

in the way the figure in Section 3.2 shows.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.33.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.8: Cache Size vs Associativity (CL=32)_

Figure 3.8 makes the data of the table more comprehensible. It shows the data for a fixed cache line size of 32 bytes. Looking at the numbers for a given cache size we can see that associativity can indeed help to reduce the number of cache misses significantly. For an 8MB cache going from direct mapping to 2-way set associative cache saves almost 44% of the cache misses. The processor can keep more of the working set in the cache with a set associative cache compared with a direct mapped cache.

In the literature one can occasionally read that introducing associativity has the same effect as doubling cache size. This is true in some extreme cases as can be seen in the jump from the 4MB to the 8MB cache. But it certainly is not true for further doubling of the associativity. As we can see in the data, the successive gains are much smaller. We should not completely discount the effects, though. In the example program the peak memory use is 5.6M. So with a 8MB cache there are unlikely to be many (more than two) uses for the same cache set. With a larger working set the savings can be higher as we can see from the larger benefits of associativity for the smaller cache sizes.

In general, increasing the associativity of a cache above 8 seems to have little effects for a single-thread workload. With the introduction of multi-core processors which use a shared L2 the situation changes. Now you basically have two programs hitting on the same cache which causes the associativity in practice to be halved (or quartered for quad-core processors). So it can be expected that, with increasing numbers of cores, the associativity of the shared caches should grow. Once this is not possible anymore (16-way set associativity is already hard) processor designers have to start using shared L3 caches and beyond, while L2 caches are potentially shared by a subset of the cores.

Another effect we can study in Figure 3.8 is how the increase in cache size helps with performance. This data cannot be interpreted without knowing about the working set size. Obviously, a cache as large as the main memory would lead to better results than a smaller cache, so there is in general no limit to the largest cache size with measurable benefits.

As already mentioned above, the size of the working set at its peak is 5.6M. This does not give us any absolute number of the maximum beneficial cache size but it allows us to estimate the number. The problem is that not all the memory used is contiguous and, therefore, we have, even with a 16M cache and a 5.6M working set, conflicts (see the benefit of the 2-way set associative 16MB cache over the direct mapped version). But it is a safe bet that with the same workload the benefits of a 32MB cache would be negligible. But who says the working set has to stay the same? Workloads are growing over time and so should the cache size. When buying machines, and one has to choose the cache size one is willing to pay for, it is worthwhile to measure the working set size. Why this is important can be seen in the figures on Figure 3.10.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.75.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.9: Test Memory Layouts_

Two types of tests are run. In the first test the elements are processed sequentially. The test program follows the pointer n but the array elements are chained so that they are traversed in the order in which they are found in memory. This can be seen in the lower part of Figure 3.9. There is one back reference from the last element. In the second test (upper part of the figure) the array elements are traversed in a random order. In both cases the array elements form a circular single-linked list.

**3.3.2 Measurements of Cache Effects**

All the figures are created by measuring a program which can simulate working sets of arbitrary size, read and write access, and sequential or random access. We have already seen some results in Figure 3.4. The program creates an array corresponding to the working set size of elements of this type:
    
    
      struct l {
        struct l *n;
        long int pad[NPAD];
      };
    

All entries are chained in a circular list using the n element, either in sequential or random order. Advancing from one entry to the next always uses the pointer, even if the elements are laid out sequentially. The pad element is the payload and it can grow arbitrarily large. In some tests the data is modified, in others the program only performs read operations.

In the performance measurements we are talking about working set sizes. The working set is made up of an array of struct l elements. A working set of 2N bytes contains

> 2N/sizeof(struct l) 

elements. Obviously sizeof(struct l) depends on the value of NPAD. For 32-bit systems, NPAD=7 means the size of each array element is 32 bytes, for 64-bit systems the size is 64 bytes.

#### Single Threaded Sequential Access

The simplest case is a simple walk over all the entries in the list. The list elements are laid out sequentially, densely packed. Whether the order of processing is forward or backward does not matter, the processor can deal with both directions equally well. What we measure here--and in all the following tests--is how long it takes to handle a single list element. The time unit is a processor cycle. Figure 3.10 shows the result. Unless otherwise specified, all measurements are made on a Pentium 4 machine in 64-bit mode which means the structure l with NPAD=0 is eight bytes in size.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.22.png)

> > _Figure 3.10: Sequential Read Access, NPAD=0_

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.23.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.11: Sequential Read for Several Sizes_

The first two measurements are polluted by noise. The measured workload is simply too small to filter the effects of the rest of the system out. We can safely assume that the values are all at the 4 cycles level. With this in mind we can see three distinct levels:

  * Up to a working set size of 214 bytes. 
  * From 215 bytes to 220 bytes. 
  * From 221 bytes and up. 

These steps can be easily explained: the processor has a 16kB L1d and 1MB L2. We do not see sharp edges in the transition from one level to the other because the caches are used by other parts of the system as well and so the cache is not exclusively available for the program data. Specifically the L2 cache is a unified cache and also used for the instructions (NB: Intel uses inclusive caches).

What is perhaps not quite expected are the actual times for the different working set sizes. The times for the L1d hits are expected: load times after an L1d hit are around 4 cycles on the P4. But what about the L2 accesses? Once the L1d is not sufficient to hold the data one might expect it would take 14 cycles or more per element since this is the access time for the L2. But the results show that only about 9 cycles are required. This discrepancy can be explained by the advanced logic in the processors. In anticipation of using consecutive memory regions, the processor _prefetches_ the next cache line. This means that when the next line is actually used it is already halfway loaded. The delay required to wait for the next cache line to be loaded is therefore much less than the L2 access time.

The effect of prefetching is even more visible once the working set size grows beyond the L2 size. Before we said that a main memory access takes 200+ cycles. Only with effective prefetching is it possible for the processor to keep the access times as low as 9 cycles. As we can see from the difference between 200 and 9, this works out nicely.

We can observe the processor while prefetching, at least indirectly. In Figure 3.11 we see the times for the same working set sizes but this time we see the graphs for different sizes of the structure l. This means we have fewer but larger elements in the list. The different sizes have the effect that the distance between the n elements in the (still consecutive) list grows. In the four cases of the graph the distance is 0, 56, 120, and 248 bytes respectively.

At the bottom we can see the line from the previous graph, but this time it appears more or less as a flat line. The times for the other cases are simply so much worse. We can see in this graph, too, the three different levels and we see the large errors in the tests with the small working set sizes (ignore them again). The lines more or less all match each other as long as only the L1d is involved. There is no prefetching necessary so all element sizes just hit the L1d for each access.

For the L2 cache hits we see that the three new lines all pretty much match each other but that they are at a higher level (about 28). This is the level of the access time for the L2. This means prefetching from L2 into L1d is basically disabled. Even with NPAD=7 we need a new cache line for each iteration of the loop; for NPAD=0, instead, the loop has to iterate eight times before the next cache line is needed. The prefetch logic cannot load a new cache line every cycle. Therefore we see a stall to load from L2 in every iteration.

It gets even more interesting once the working set size exceeds the L2 capacity. Now all four lines vary widely. The different element sizes play obviously a big role in the difference in performance. The processor should recognize the size of the strides and not fetch unnecessary cache lines for NPAD=15 and 31 since the element size is smaller than the prefetch window (see Section 6.3.1). Where the element size is hampering the prefetching efforts is a result of a limitation of hardware prefetching: it cannot cross page boundaries. We are reducing the effectiveness of the hardware scheduler by 50% for each size increase. If the hardware prefetcher were allowed to cross page boundaries and the next page is not resident or valid the OS would have to get involved in locating the page. That means the program would experience a page fault it did not initiate itself. This is completely unacceptable since the processor does not know whether a page is not present or does not exist. In the latter case the OS would have to abort the process. In any case, given that, for NPAD=7 and higher, we need one cache line per list element the hardware prefetcher cannot do much. There simply is no time to load the data from memory since all the processor does is read one word and then load the next element.

Another big reason for the slowdown are the misses of the TLB cache. This is a cache where the results of the translation of a virtual address to a physical address are stored, as is explained in more detail in Section 4. The TLB cache is quite small since it has to be extremely fast. If more pages are accessed repeatedly than the TLB cache has entries for the translation from virtual to physical address has to be constantly repeated. This is a very costly operation. With larger element sizes the cost of a TLB lookup is amortized over fewer elements. That means the total number of TLB entries which have to be computed per list element is higher.

To observe the TLB effects we can run a different test. For one measurement we lay out the elements sequentially as usual. We use NPAD=7 for elements which occupy one entire cache line. For the second measurement we place each list element on a separate page. The rest of each page is left untouched and we do not count it in the total for the working set size. {_Yes, this is a bit inconsistent because in the other tests we count the unused part of the struct in the element size and we could define NPAD so that each element fills a page. In that case the working set sizes would be very different. This is not the point of this test, though, and since prefetching is ineffective anyway this makes little difference._} The consequence is that, for the first measurement, each list iteration requires a new cache line and, for every 64 elements, a new page. For the second measurement each iteration requires loading a new cache line which is on a new page.

> 
> > _Figure 3.12: TLB Influence for Sequential Read_

The result can be seen in Figure 3.12. The measurements were performed on the same machine as Figure 3.11. Due to limitations of the available RAM the working set size had to be restricted to 224 bytes which requires 1GB to place the objects on separate pages. The lower, red curve corresponds exactly to the NPAD=7 curve in Figure 3.11. We see the distinct steps showing the sizes of the L1d and L2 caches. The second curve looks radically different. The important feature is the huge spike starting when the working set size reaches 213 bytes. This is when the TLB cache overflows. With an element size of 64 bytes we can compute that the TLB cache has 64 entries. There are no page faults affecting the cost since the program locks the memory to prevent it from being swapped out.

As can be seen the number of cycles it takes to compute the physical address and store it in the TLB is very high. The graph in Figure 3.12 shows the extreme case, but it should now be clear that a significant factor in the slowdown for larger NPAD values is the reduced efficiency of the TLB cache. Since the physical address has to be computed before a cache line can be read for either L2 or main memory the address translation penalties are additive to the memory access times. This in part explains why the total cost per list element for NPAD=31 is higher than the theoretical access time for the RAM.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.24.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.13: Sequential Read and Write, NPAD=1_

We can glimpse a few more details of the prefetch implementation by looking at the data of test runs where the list elements are modified. Figure 3.13 shows three lines. The element width is in all cases 16 bytes. The first line is the now familiar list walk which serves as a baseline. The second line, labeled "Inc", simply increments the pad[0] member of the current element before going on to the next. The third line, labeled "Addnext0", takes the pad[0] list element of the _next_ element and adds it to the pad[0] member of the current list element.

The naive assumption would be that the "Addnext0" test runs slower because it has more work to do. Before advancing to the next list element a value from that element has to be loaded. This is why it is surprising to see that this test actually runs, for some working set sizes, faster than the "Inc" test. The explanation for this is that the load from the next list element is basically a forced prefetch. Whenever the program advances to the next list element we know for sure that element is already in the L1d cache. As a result we see that the "Addnext0" performs as well as the simple "Follow" test as long as the working set size fits into the L2 cache.

The "Addnext0" test runs out of L2 faster than the "Inc" test, though. It needs more data loaded from main memory. This is why the "Addnext0" test reaches the 28 cycles level for a working set size of 221 bytes. The 28 cycles level is twice as high as the 14 cycles level the "Follow" test reaches. This is easy to explain, too. Since the other two tests modify memory an L2 cache eviction to make room for new cache lines cannot simply discard the data. Instead it has to be written to memory. This means the available bandwidth on the FSB is cut in half, hence doubling the time it takes to transfer the data from main memory to L2.

> 
> > _Figure 3.14: Advantage of Larger L2/L3 Caches_

One last aspect of the sequential, efficient cache handling is the size of the cache. This should be obvious but it still should be pointed out. Figure 3.14 shows the timing for the Increment benchmark with 128-byte elements (NPAD=15 on 64-bit machines). This time we see the measurement from three different machines. The first two machines are P4s, the last one a Core2 processor. The first two differentiate themselves by having different cache sizes. The first processor has a 32k L1d and an 1M L2. The second one has 16k L1d, 512k L2, and 2M L3. The Core2 processor has 32k L1d and 4M L2.

The interesting part of the graph is not necessarily how well the Core2 processor performs relative to the other two (although it is impressive). The main point of interest here is the region where the working set size is too large for the respective last level cache and the main memory gets heavily involved.

**Table 3.2: L2 Hits and Misses for Sequential and Random Walks, NPAD=0**

As expected, the larger the last level cache is the longer the curve stays at the low level corresponding to the L2 access costs. The important part to notice is the performance advantage this provides. The second processor (which is slightly older) can perform the work on the working set of 220 bytes twice as fast as the first processor. All thanks to the increased last level cache size. The Core2 processor with its 4M L2 performs even better.

For a random workload this might not mean that much. But if the workload can be tailored to the size of the last level cache the program performance can be increased quite dramatically. This is why it sometimes is worthwhile to spend the extra money for a processor with a larger cache.

#### Single Threaded Random Access Measurements

We have seen that the processor is able to hide most of the main memory and even L2 access latency by prefetching cache lines into L2 and L1d. This can work well only when the memory access is predictable, though.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.26.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.15: Sequential vs Random Read, NPAD=0_

If the access is unpredictable or random the situation is quite different. Figure 3.15 compares the per-list-element times for the sequential access (same as in Figure 3.10) with the times when the list elements are randomly distributed in the working set. The order is determined by the linked list which is randomized. There is no way for the processor to reliably prefetch data. This can only work by chance if elements which are used shortly after one another are also close to each other in memory.

There are two important points to note in Figure 3.15. First, the large number is cycles needed for growing working set sizes. The machine makes it possible to access the main memory in 200-300 cycles but here we reach 450 cycles and more. We have seen this phenomenon before (compare Figure 3.11). The automatic prefetching is actually working to a disadvantage here.

The second interesting point is that the curve is not flattening at various plateaus as it has been for the sequential access cases. The curve keeps on rising. To explain this we can measure the L2 access of the program for the various working set sizes. The result can be seen in Figure 3.16 and Table 3.2.

The figure shows that, when the working set size is larger than the L2 size, the cache miss ratio (L2 misses / L2 access) starts to grow. The curve has a similar form to the one in Figure 3.15: it rises quickly, declines slightly, and starts to rise again. There is a strong correlation with the cycles per list element graph. The L2 miss rate will grow until it eventually reaches close to 100%. Given a large enough working set (and RAM) the probability that any of the randomly picked cache lines is in L2 or is in the process of being loaded can be reduced arbitrarily.

The increasing cache miss rate alone explains some of the costs. But there is another factor. Looking at Table 3.2 we can see in the L2/#Iter columns that the total number of L2 uses per iteration of the program is growing. Each working set is twice as large as the one before. So, without caching we would expect double the main memory accesses. With caches and (almost) perfect predictability we see the modest increase in the L2 use shown in the data for sequential access. The increase is due to the increase of the working set size and nothing else.

> 
> > _Figure 3.17: Page-Wise Randomization, NPAD=7_

For random access the per-element time increases by more than 100% for each doubling of the working set size. This means the average access time per list element increases since the working set size only doubles. The reason behind this is a rising rate of TLB misses. In Figure 3.17 we see the cost for random accesses for NPAD=7. Only this time the randomization is modified. While in the normal case the entire list of randomized as one block (indicated by the label âˆž) the other 11 curves show randomizations which are performed in smaller blocks. For the curve labeled '60' each set of 60 pages (245.760 bytes) is randomized individually. That means all list elements in the block are traversed before going over to an element in the next block. This has the effect that number of TLB entries which are used at any one time is limited.

The element size for NPAD=7 is 64 bytes, which corresponds to the cache line size. Due to the randomized order of the list elements it is unlikely that the hardware prefetcher has any effect, most certainly not for more than a handful of elements. This means the L2 cache miss rate does not differ significantly from the randomization of the entire list in one block. The performance of the test with increasing block size approaches asymptotically the curve for the one-block randomization. This means the performance of this latter test case is significantly influenced by the TLB misses. If the TLB misses can be lowered the performance increases significantly (in one test we will see later up to 38%).

**3.3.3 Write Behavior**

Before we start looking at the cache behavior when multiple execution contexts (threads or processes) use the same memory we have to explore a detail of cache implementations. Caches are supposed to be coherent and this coherency is supposed to be completely transparent for the userlevel code. Kernel code is a different story; it occasionally requires cache flushes.

This specifically means that, if a cache line is modified, the result for the system after this point in time is the same as if there were no cache at all and the main memory location itself had been modified. This can be implemented in two ways or policies:

  * write-through cache implementation; 
  * write-back cache implementation. 

The write-through cache is the simplest way to implement cache coherency. If the cache line is written to, the processor immediately also writes the cache line into main memory. This ensures that, at all times, the main memory and cache are in sync. The cache content could simply be discarded whenever a cache line is replaced. This cache policy is simple but not very fast. A program which, for instance, modifies a local variable over and over again would create a lot of traffic on the FSB even though the data is likely not used anywhere else and might be short-lived.

The write-back policy is more sophisticated. Here the processor does not immediately write the modified cache line back to main memory. Instead, the cache line is only marked as dirty. When the cache line is dropped from the cache at some point in the future the dirty bit will instruct the processor to write the data back at that time instead of just discarding the content.

Write-back caches have the chance to be significantly better performing, which is why most memory in a system with a decent processor is cached this way. The processor can even take advantage of free capacity on the FSB to store the content of a cache line before the line has to be evacuated. This allows the dirty bit to be cleared and the processor can just drop the cache line when the room in the cache is needed.

But there is a significant problem with the write-back implementation. When more than one processor (or core or hyper-thread) is available and accessing the same memory it must still be assured that both processors see the same memory content at all times. If a cache line is dirty on one processor (i.e., it has not been written back yet) and a second processor tries to read the same memory location, the read operation cannot just go out to the main memory. Instead the content of the first processor's cache line is needed. In the next section we will see how this is currently implemented.

Before we get to this there are two more cache policies to mention:

  * write-combining; and 
  * uncacheable. 

Both these policies are used for special regions of the address space which are not backed by real RAM. The kernel sets up these policies for the address ranges (on x86 processors using the Memory Type Range Registers, MTRRs) and the rest happens automatically. The MTRRs are also usable to select between write-through and write-back policies.

Write-combining is a limited caching optimization more often used for RAM on devices such as graphics cards. Since the transfer costs to the devices are much higher than the local RAM access it is even more important to avoid doing too many transfers. Transferring an entire cache line just because a word in the line has been written is wasteful if the next operation modifies the next word. One can easily imagine that this is a common occurrence, the memory for horizontal neighboring pixels on a screen are in most cases neighbors, too. As the name suggests, write-combining combines multiple write accesses before the cache line is written out. In ideal cases the entire cache line is modified word by word and, only after the last word is written, the cache line is written to the device. This can speed up access to RAM on devices significantly.

Finally there is uncacheable memory. This usually means the memory location is not backed by RAM at all. It might be a special address which is hardcoded to have some functionality outside the CPU. For commodity hardware this most often is the case for memory mapped address ranges which translate to accesses to cards and devices attached to a bus (PCIe etc). On embedded boards one sometimes finds such a memory address which can be used to turn an LED on and off. Caching such an address would obviously be a bad idea. LEDs in this context are used for debugging or status reports and one wants to see this as soon as possible. The memory on PCIe cards can change without the CPU's interaction, so this memory should not be cached.

**3.3.4 Multi-Processor Support**

In the previous section we have already pointed out the problem we have when multiple processors come into play. Even multi-core processors have the problem for those cache levels which are not shared (at least the L1d).

It is completely impractical to provide direct access from one processor to the cache of another processor. The connection is simply not fast enough, for a start. The practical alternative is to transfer the cache content over to the other processor in case it is needed. Note that this also applies to caches which are not shared on the same processor.

The question now is when does this cache line transfer have to happen? This question is pretty easy to answer: when one processor needs a cache line which is dirty in another processor's cache for reading or writing. But how can a processor determine whether a cache line is dirty in another processor's cache? Assuming it is just because a cache line is loaded by another processor would be suboptimal (at best). Usually the majority of memory accesses are read accesses and the resulting cache lines are not dirty. Processor operations on cache lines are frequent (of course, why else would we have this paper?) which means broadcasting information about changed cache lines after each write access would be impractical.

What developed over the years is the MESI cache coherency protocol (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid). The protocol is named after the four states a cache line can be in when using the MESI protocol:

  * **Modified**: The local processor has modified the cache line. This also implies it is the only copy in any cache. 
  * **Exclusive**: The cache line is not modified but known to not be loaded into any other processor's cache. 
  * **Shared**: The cache line is not modified and might exist in another processor's cache. 
  * **Invalid**: The cache line is invalid, i.e., unused. 

This protocol developed over the years from simpler versions which were less complicated but also less efficient. With these four states it is possible to efficiently implement write-back caches while also supporting concurrent use of read-only data on different processors.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.13.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.18: MESI Protocol Transitions_

The state changes are accomplished without too much effort by the processors listening, or snooping, on the other processors' work. Certain operations a processor performs are announced on external pins and thus make the processor's cache handling visible to the outside. The address of the cache line in question is visible on the address bus. In the following description of the states and their transitions (shown in Figure 3.18) we will point out when the bus is involved.

Initially all cache lines are empty and hence also Invalid. If data is loaded into the cache for writing the cache changes to Modified. If the data is loaded for reading the new state depends on whether another processor has the cache line loaded as well. If this is the case then the new state is Shared, otherwise Exclusive.

If a Modified cache line is read from or written to on the local processor, the instruction can use the current cache content and the state does not change. If a second processor wants to read from the cache line the first processor has to send the content of its cache to the second processor and then it can change the state to Shared. The data sent to the second processor is also received and processed by the memory controller which stores the content in memory. If this did not happen the cache line could not be marked as Shared. If the second processor wants to write to the cache line the first processor sends the cache line content and marks the cache line locally as Invalid. This is the infamous "Request For Ownership" (RFO) operation. Performing this operation in the last level cache, just like the I->M transition is comparatively expensive. For write-through caches we also have to add the time it takes to write the new cache line content to the next higher-level cache or the main memory, further increasing the cost.

If a cache line is in the Shared state and the local processor reads from it no state change is necessary and the read request can be fulfilled from the cache. If the cache line is locally written to the cache line can be used as well but the state changes to Modified. It also requires that all other possible copies of the cache line in other processors are marked as Invalid. Therefore the write operation has to be announced to the other processors via an RFO message. If the cache line is requested for reading by a second processor nothing has to happen. The main memory contains the current data and the local state is already Shared. In case a second processor wants to write to the cache line (RFO) the cache line is simply marked Invalid. No bus operation is needed.

The Exclusive state is mostly identical to the Shared state with one crucial difference: a local write operation does _not_ have to be announced on the bus. The local cache copy is known to be the only one. This can be a huge advantage so the processor will try to keep as many cache lines as possible in the Exclusive state instead of the Shared state. The latter is the fallback in case the information is not available at that moment. The Exclusive state can also be left out completely without causing functional problems. It is only the performance that will suffer since the E->M transition is much faster than the S->M transition.

From this description of the state transitions it should be clear where the costs specific to multi-processor operations are. Yes, filling caches is still expensive but now we also have to look out for RFO messages. Whenever such a message has to be sent things are going to be slow.

There are two situations when RFO messages are necessary:

  * A thread is migrated from one processor to another and all the cache lines have to be moved over to the new processor once. 
  * A cache line is truly needed in two different processors. {_At a smaller level the same is true for two cores on the same processor. The costs are just a bit smaller. The RFO message is likely to be sent many times._} 

In multi-thread or multi-process programs there is always some need for synchronization; this synchronization is implemented using memory. So there are some valid RFO messages. They still have to be kept as infrequent as possible. There are other sources of RFO messages, though. In Section 6 we will explain these scenarios. The Cache coherency protocol messages must be distributed among the processors of the system. A MESI transition cannot happen until it is clear that all the processors in the system have had a chance to reply to the message. That means that the longest possible time a reply can take determines the speed of the coherency protocol. {_Which is why we see nowadays, for instance, AMD Opteron systems with three sockets. Each processor is exactly one hop away given that the processors only have three hyperlinks and one is needed for the Southbridge connection._} Collisions on the bus are possible, latency can be high in NUMA systems, and of course sheer traffic volume can slow things down. All good reasons to focus on avoiding unnecessary traffic.

There is one more problem related to having more than one processor in play. The effects are highly machine specific but in principle the problem always exists: the FSB is a shared resource. In most machines all processors are connected via one single bus to the memory controller (see Figure 2.1). If a single processor can saturate the bus (as is usually the case) then two or four processors sharing the same bus will restrict the bandwidth available to each processor even more.

Even if each processor has its own bus to the memory controller as in Figure 2.2 there is still the bus to the memory modules. Usually this is one bus but, even in the extended model in Figure 2.2, concurrent accesses to the same memory module will limit the bandwidth.

The same is true with the AMD model where each processor can have local memory. Yes, all processors can concurrently access their local memory quickly. But multi-thread and multi-process programs--at least from time to time--have to access the same memory regions to synchronize.

Concurrency is severely limited by the finite bandwidth available for the implementation of the necessary synchronization. Programs need to be carefully designed to minimize accesses from different processors and cores to the same memory locations. The following measurements will show this and the other cache effects related to multi-threaded code.

#### Multi Threaded Measurements

To ensure that the gravity of the problems introduced by concurrently using the same cache lines on different processors is understood, we will look here at some more performance graphs for the same program we used before. This time, though, more than one thread is running at the same time. What is measured is the fastest runtime of any of the threads. This means the time for a complete run when all threads are done is even higher. The machine used has four processors; the tests use up to four threads. All processors share one bus to the memory controller and there is only one bus to the memory modules.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.30.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.19: Sequential Read Access, Multiple Threads_

Figure 3.19 shows the performance for sequential read-only access for 128 bytes entries (NPAD=15 on 64-bit machines). For the curve for one thread we can expect a curve similar to Figure 3.11. The measurements are for a different machine so the actual numbers vary.

The important part in this figure is of course the behavior when running multiple threads. Note that no memory is modified and no attempts are made to keep the threads in sync when walking the linked list. Even though no RFO messages are necessary and all the cache lines can be shared, we see up to an 18% performance decrease for the fastest thread when two threads are used and up to 34% when four threads are used. Since no cache lines have to be transported between the processors this slowdown is solely caused by one or both of the two bottlenecks: the shared bus from the processor to the memory controller and bus from the memory controller to the memory modules. Once the working set size is larger than the L3 cache in this machine all three threads will be prefetching new list elements. Even with two threads the available bandwidth is not sufficient to scale linearly (i.e., have no penalty from running multiple threads).

When we modify memory things get even uglier. Figure 3.20 shows the results for the sequential Increment test.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.29.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.20: Sequential Increment, Multiple Threads_

This graph is using a logarithmic scale for the Y axis. So, do not be fooled by the apparently small differences. We still have about a 18% penalty for running two threads and now an amazing 93% penalty for running four threads. This means the prefetch traffic together with the write-back traffic is pretty much saturating the bus when four threads are used.

We use the logarithmic scale to show the results for the L1d range. What can be seen is that, as soon as more than one thread is running, the L1d is basically ineffective. The single-thread access times exceed 20 cycles only when the L1d is not sufficient to hold the working set. When multiple threads are running, those access times are hit immediately, even with the smallest working set sizes.

One aspect of the problem is not shown here. It is hard to measure with this specific test program. Even though the test modifies memory and we therefore must expect RFO messages we do not see higher costs for the L2 range when more than one thread is used. The program would have to use a large amount of memory and all threads must access the same memory in parallel. This is hard to achieve without a lot of synchronization which would then dominate the execution time.

Finally in Figure 3.21 we have the numbers for the Addnextlast test with random access of memory. This figure is provided mainly to show to the appallingly high numbers. It now take around 1,500 cycles to process a single list element in the extreme case. The use of more threads is even more questionable. We can summarize the efficiency of multiple thread use in a table.

> **Table 3.3: Efficiency for Multiple Threads**

The table shows the efficiency for the multi-thread run with the largest working set size in the three figures on Figure 3.21. The number shows the best possible speed-up the test program incurs for the largest working set size by using two or four threads. For two threads the theoretical limits for the speed-up are 2 and, for four threads, 4. The numbers for two threads are not that bad. But for four threads the numbers for the last test show that it is almost not worth it to scale beyond two threads. The additional benefit is minuscule. We can see this more easily if we represent the data in Figure 3.21 a bit differently.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.28.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.22: Speed-Up Through Parallelism_

The curves in Figure 3.22 show the speed-up factors, i.e., relative performance compared to the code executed by a single thread. We have to ignore the smallest sizes, the measurements are not accurate enough. For the range of the L2 and L3 cache we can see that we indeed achieve almost linear acceleration. We almost reach factors of 2 and 4 respectively. But as soon as the L3 cache is not sufficient to hold the working set the numbers crash. They crash to the point that the speed-up of two and four threads is identical (see the fourth column in Table 3.3). This is one of the reasons why one can hardly find motherboard with sockets for more than four CPUs all using the same memory controller. Machines with more processors have to be built differently (see Section 5).

These numbers are not universal. In some cases even working sets which fit into the last level cache will not allow linear speed-ups. In fact, this is the norm since threads are usually not as decoupled as is the case in this test program. On the other hand it is possible to work with large working sets and still take advantage of more than two threads. Doing this requires thought, though. We will talk about some approaches in Section 6.

#### Special Case: Hyper-Threads

Hyper-Threads (sometimes called Symmetric Multi-Threading, SMT) are implemented by the CPU and are a special case since the individual threads cannot really run concurrently. They all share almost all the processing resources except for the register set. Individual cores and CPUs still work in parallel but the threads implemented on each core are limited by this restriction. In theory there can be many threads per core but, so far, Intel's CPUs at most have two threads per core. The CPU is responsible for time-multiplexing the threads. This alone would not make much sense, though. The real advantage is that the CPU can schedule another hyper-thread when the currently running hyper-thread is delayed. In most cases this is a delay caused by memory accesses.

If two threads are running on one hyper-threaded core the program is only more efficient than the single-threaded code if the _combined_ runtime of both threads is lower than the runtime of the single-threaded code. This is possible by overlapping the wait times for different memory accesses which usually would happen sequentially. A simple calculation shows the minimum requirement on the cache hit rate to achieve a certain speed-up.

The execution time for a program can be approximated with a simple model with only one level of cache as follows (see [htimpact]):

> Texe = N[(1-Fmem)Tproc \+ Fmem(GhitTcache \+ (1-Ghit)Tmiss)] 

The meaning of the variables is as follows:

> N 
> =
> Number of instructions.
> 
> Fmem
> =
> Fraction of N that access memory.
> 
> Ghit
> =
> Fraction of loads that hit the cache.
> 
> Tproc
> =
> Number of cycles per instruction.
> 
> Tcache
> =
> Number of cycles for cache hit.
> 
> Tmiss
> =
> Number of cycles for cache miss.
> 
> Texe
> =
> Execution time for program.

For it to make any sense to use two threads the execution time of each of the two threads must be at most half of that of the single-threaded code. The only variable on either side is the number of cache hits. If we solve the equation for the minimum cache hit rate required to not slow down the thread execution by 50% or more we get the graph in Figure 3.23.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.14.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.23: Minimum Cache Hit Rate For Speed-Up_

The X-axis represents the cache hit rate Ghit of the single-thread code. The Y-axis shows the required cache hit rate for the multi-threaded code. This value can never be higher than the single-threaded hit rate since, otherwise, the single-threaded code would use that improved code, too. For single-threaded hit rates below 55% the program can in all cases benefit from using threads. The CPU is more or less idle enough due to cache misses to enable running a second hyper-thread.

The green area is the target. If the slowdown for the thread is less than 50% and the workload of each thread is halved the combined runtime might be less than the single-thread runtime. For the modeled system here (numbers for a P4 with hyper-threads were used) a program with a hit rate of 60% for the single-threaded code requires a hit rate of at least 10% for the dual-threaded program. That is usually doable. But if the single-threaded code has a hit rate of 95% then the multi-threaded code needs a hit rate of at least 80%. That is harder. Especially, and this is the problem with hyper-threads, because now the effective cache size (L1d here, in practice also L2 and so on) available to each hyper-thread is cut in half. Both hyper-threads use the same cache to load their data. If the working set of the two threads is non-overlapping the original 95% hit rate could also be cut in half and is therefore much lower than the required 80%.

Hyper-Threads are therefore only useful in a limited range of situations. The cache hit rate of the single-threaded code must be low enough that given the equations above and reduced cache size the new hit rate still meets the goal. Then and only then can it make any sense at all to use hyper-threads. Whether the result is faster in practice depends on whether the processor is sufficiently able to overlap the wait times in one thread with execution times in the other threads. The overhead of parallelizing the code must be added to the new total runtime and this additional cost often cannot be neglected.

In Section 6.3.4 we will see a technique where threads collaborate closely and the tight coupling through the common cache is actually an advantage. This technique can be applicable to many situations if only the programmers are willing to put in the time and energy to extend their code.

What should be clear is that if the two hyper-threads execute completely different code (i.e., the two threads are treated like separate processors by the OS to execute separate processes) the cache size is indeed cut in half which means a significant increase in cache misses. Such OS scheduling practices are questionable unless the caches are sufficiently large. Unless the workload for the machine consists of processes which, through their design, can indeed benefit from hyper-threads it might be best to turn off hyper-threads in the computer's BIOS. {_Another reason to keep hyper-threads enabled is debugging. SMT is astonishingly good at finding some sets of problems in parallel code._}

**3.3.5 Other Details**

So far we talked about the address as consisting of three parts, tag, set index, and cache line offset. But what address is actually used? All relevant processors today provide virtual address spaces to processes, which means that there are two different kinds of addresses: virtual and physical.

The problem with virtual addresses is that they are not unique. A virtual address can, over time, refer to different physical memory addresses. The same address in different process also likely refers to different physical addresses. So it is always better to use the physical memory address, right?

The problem here is that instructions use virtual addresses and these have to be translated with the help of the Memory Management Unit (MMU) into physical addresses. This is a non-trivial operation. In the pipeline to execute an instruction the physical address might only be available at a later stage. This means that the cache logic has to be very quick in determining whether the memory location is cached. If virtual addresses could be used the cache lookup can happen much earlier in the pipeline and in case of a cache hit the memory content can be made available. The result is that more of the memory access costs could be hidden by the pipeline.

Processor designers are currently using virtual address tagging for the first level caches. These caches are rather small and can be cleared without too much pain. At least partial clearing the cache is necessary if the page table tree of a process changes. It might be possible to avoid a complete flush if the processor has an instruction which specifies the virtual address range which has changed. Given the low latency of L1i and L1d caches (~3 cycles) using virtual addresses is almost mandatory.

For larger caches including L2, L3, ... caches physical address tagging is needed. These caches have a higher latency and the virtual->physical address translation can finish in time. Because these caches are larger (i.e., a lot of information is lost when they are flushed) and refilling them takes a long time due to the main memory access latency, flushing them often would be costly.

It should, in general, not be necessary to know about the details of the address handling in those caches. They cannot be changed and all the factors which would influence the performance are normally something which should be avoided or is associated with high cost. Overflowing the cache capacity is bad and all caches run into problems early if the majority of the used cache lines fall into the same set. The latter can be avoided with virtually addressed caches but is impossible for user-level processes to avoid for caches addressed using physical addresses. The only detail one might want to keep in mind is to not map the same physical memory location to two or more virtual addresses in the same process, if at all possible.

Another detail of the caches which is rather uninteresting to programmers is the cache replacement strategy. Most caches evict the Least Recently Used (LRU) element first. This is always a good default strategy. With larger associativity (and associativity might indeed grow further in the coming years due to the addition of more cores) maintaining the LRU list becomes more and more expensive and we might see different strategies adopted.

As for the cache replacement there is not much a programmer can do. If the cache is using physical address tags there is no way to find out how the virtual addresses correlate with the cache sets. It might be that cache lines in all logical pages are mapped to the same cache sets, leaving much of the cache unused. If anything, it is the job of the OS to arrange that this does not happen too often.

With the advent of virtualization things get even more complicated. Now not even the OS has control over the assignment of physical memory. The Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, aka hypervisor) is responsible for the physical memory assignment.

The best a programmer can do is to a) use logical memory pages completely and b) use page sizes as large as meaningful to diversify the physical addresses as much as possible. Larger page sizes have other benefits, too, but this is another topic (see Section 4).

### 3.4 Instruction Cache

Not just the data used by the processor is cached; the instructions executed by the processor are also cached. However, this cache is much less problematic than the data cache. There are several reasons:

  * The quantity of code which is executed depends on the size of the code that is needed. The size of the code in general depends on the complexity of the problem. The complexity of the problem is fixed. 
  * While the program's data handling is designed by the programmer the program's instructions are usually generated by a compiler. The compiler writers know about the rules for good code generation. 
  * Program flow is much more predictable than data access patterns. Today's CPUs are very good at detecting patterns. This helps with prefetching. 
  * Code always has quite good spatial and temporal locality. 

There are a few rules programmers should follow but these mainly consist of rules on how to use the tools. We will discuss them in Section 6. Here we talk only about the technical details of the instruction cache.

Ever since the core clock of CPUs increased dramatically and the difference in speed between cache (even first level cache) and core grew, CPUs have been pipelined. That means the execution of an instruction happens in stages. First an instruction is decoded, then the parameters are prepared, and finally it is executed. Such a pipeline can be quite long (> 20 stages for Intel's Netburst architecture). A long pipeline means that if the pipeline stalls (i.e., the instruction flow through it is interrupted) it takes a while to get up to speed again. Pipeline stalls happen, for instance, if the location of the next instruction cannot be correctly predicted or if it takes too long to load the next instruction (e.g., when it has to be read from memory).

As a result CPU designers spend a lot of time and chip real estate on branch prediction so that pipeline stalls happen as infrequently as possible.

On CISC processors the decoding stage can also take some time. The x86 and x86-64 processors are especially affected. In recent years these processors therefore do not cache the raw byte sequence of the instructions in L1i but instead they cache the decoded instructions. L1i in this case is called the "trace cache". Trace caching allows the processor to skip over the first steps of the pipeline in case of a cache hit which is especially good if the pipeline stalled.

As said before, the caches from L2 on are unified caches which contain both code and data. Obviously here the code is cached in the byte sequence form and not decoded.

To achieve the best performance there are only a few rules related to the instruction cache:

  1. Generate code which is as small as possible. There are exceptions when software pipelining for the sake of using pipelines requires creating more code or where the overhead of using small code is too high. 
  2. Whenever possible, help the processor to make good prefetching decisions. This can be done through code layout or with explicit prefetching. 

These rules are usually enforced by the code generation of a compiler. There are a few things the programmer can do and we will talk about them in Section 6.

**3.4.1 Self Modifying Code**

In early computer days memory was a premium. People went to great lengths to reduce the size of the program to make more room for program data. One trick frequently deployed was to change the program itself over time. Such Self Modifying Code (SMC) is occasionally still found, these days mostly for performance reasons or in security exploits.

SMC should in general be avoided. Though it is generally executed correctly there are boundary cases in which it is not and it creates performance problems if not done correctly. Obviously, code which is changed cannot be kept in the trace cache which contains the decoded instructions. But even if the trace cache is not used because the code has not been executed at all (or for some time) the processor might have problems. If an upcoming instruction is changed while it already entered the pipeline the processor has to throw away a lot of work and start all over again. There are even situations where most of the state of the processor has to be tossed away.

Finally, since the processor assumes - for simplicity reasons and because it is true in 99.9999999% of all cases - that the code pages are immutable, the L1i implementation does not use the MESI protocol but instead a simplified SI protocol. This means if modifications are detected a lot of pessimistic assumptions have to be made.

It is highly advised to avoid SMC whenever possible. Memory is not such a scarce resource anymore. It is better to write separate functions instead of modifying one function according to specific needs. Maybe one day SMC support can be made optional and we can detect exploit code trying to modify code this way. If SMC absolutely has to be used, the write operations should bypass the cache as to not create problems with data in L1d needed in L1i. See Section 6.1 for more information on these instructions.

Normally on Linux it is easy to recognize programs which contain SMC. All program code is write-protected when built with the regular toolchain. The programmer has to perform significant magic at link time to create an executable where the code pages are writable. When this happens, modern Intel x86 and x86-64 processors have dedicated performance counters which count uses of self-modifying code. With the help of these counters it is quite easily possible to recognize programs with SMC even if the program will succeed due to relaxed permissions.

### 3.5 Cache Miss Factors

We have already seen that when memory accesses miss the caches, the costs skyrocket. Sometimes this is not avoidable and it is important to understand the actual costs and what can be done to mitigate the problem.

**3.5.1 Cache and Memory Bandwidth**

To get a better understanding of the capabilities of the processors we measure the bandwidth available in optimal circumstances. This measurement is especially interesting since different processor versions vary widely. This is why this section is filled with the data of several different machines. The program to measure performance uses the SSE instructions of the x86 and x86-64 processors to load or store 16 bytes at once. The working set is increased from 1kB to 512MB just as in our other tests and it is measured how many bytes per cycle can be loaded or stored.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.60.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.24: Pentium 4 Bandwidth_

Figure 3.24 shows the performance on a 64-bit Intel Netburst processor. For working set sizes which fit into L1d the processor is able to read the full 16 bytes per cycle, i.e., one load instruction is performed per cycle (the movaps instruction moves 16 bytes at once). The test does not do anything with the read data, we test only the read instructions themselves. As soon as the L1d is not sufficient anymore the performance goes down dramatically to less than 6 bytes per cycle. The step at 218 bytes is due to the exhaustion of the DTLB cache which means additional work for each new page. Since the reading is sequential prefetching can predict the accesses perfectly and the FSB can stream the memory content at about 5.3 bytes per cycle for all sizes of the working set. The prefetched data is not propagated into L1d, though. These are of course numbers which will never be achievable in a real program. Think of them as practical limits.

What is more astonishing than the read performance is the write and copy performance. The write performance, even for small working set sizes, does not ever rise above 4 bytes per cycle. This indicates that, in these Netburst processors, Intel elected to use a Write-Through mode for L1d where the performance is obviously limited by the L2 speed. This also means that the performance of the copy test, which copies from one memory region into a second, non-overlapping memory region, is not significantly worse. The necessary read operations are so much faster and can partially overlap with the write operations. The most noteworthy detail of the write and copy measurements is the low performance once the L2 cache is not sufficient anymore. The performance drops to 0.5 bytes per cycle! That means write operations are by a factor of ten slower than the read operations. This means optimizing those operations is even more important for the performance of the program.

In Figure 3.25 we see the results on the same processor but with two threads running, one pinned to each of the two hyper-threads of the processor.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.61.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.25: P4 Bandwidth with 2 Hyper-Threads_

The graph is shown at the same scale as the previous one to illustrate the differences and the curves are a bit jittery simply because of the problem of measuring two concurrent threads. The results are as expected. Since the hyper-threads share all the resources except the registers each thread has only half the cache and bandwidth available. That means even though each thread has to wait a lot and could award the other thread with execution time this does not make any difference since the other thread also has to wait for the memory. This truly shows the worst possible use of hyper-threads.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.62.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.26: Core 2 Bandwidth_

Compared to Figures 3.24 and 3.25 the results in Figures 3.26 and 3.27 look quite different for an Intel Core 2 processor. This is a dual-core processor with shared L2 which is four times as big as the L2 on the P4 machine. This only explains the delayed drop-off of the write and copy performance, though.

There are much bigger differences. The read performance throughout the working set range hovers around the optimal 16 bytes per cycle. The drop-off in the read performance after 220 bytes is again due to the working set being too big for the DTLB. Achieving these high numbers means the processor is not only able to prefetch the data and transport the data in time. It also means the data is prefetched into L1d.

The write and copy performance is dramatically different, too. The processor does not have a Write-Through policy; written data is stored in L1d and only evicted when necessary. This allows for write speeds close to the optimal 16 bytes per cycle. Once L1d is not sufficient anymore the performance drops significantly. As with the Netburst processor, the write performance is significantly lower. Due to the high read performance the difference is even higher here. In fact, when even the L2 is not sufficient anymore the speed difference increases to a factor of 20! This does not mean the Core 2 processors perform poorly. To the contrary, their performance is always better than the Netburst core's.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.63.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.27: Core 2 Bandwidth with 2 Threads_

In Figure 3.27, the test runs two threads, one on each of the two cores of the Core 2 processor. Both threads access the same memory, not necessarily perfectly in sync, though. The results for the read performance are not different from the single-threaded case. A few more jitters are visible which is to be expected in any multi-threaded test case.

The interesting point is the write and copy performance for working set sizes which would fit into L1d. As can be seen in the figure, the performance is the same as if the data had to be read from the main memory. Both threads compete for the same memory location and RFO messages for the cache lines have to be sent. The problematic point is that these requests are not handled at the speed of the L2 cache, even though both cores share the cache. Once the L1d cache is not sufficient anymore modified entries are flushed from each core's L1d into the shared L2. At that point the performance increases significantly since now the L1d misses are satisfied by the L2 cache and RFO messages are only needed when the data has not yet been flushed. This is why we see a 50% reduction in speed for these sizes of the working set. The asymptotic behavior is as expected: since both cores share the same FSB each core gets half the FSB bandwidth which means for large working sets each thread's performance is about half that of the single threaded case.

Because there are significant differences between the processor versions of one vendor it is certainly worthwhile looking at the performance of other vendors' processors, too. Figure 3.28 shows the performance of an AMD family 10h Opteron processor. This processor has 64kB L1d, 512kB L2, and 2MB of L3. The L3 cache is shared between all cores of the processor. The results of the performance test can be seen in Figure 3.28.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.64.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.28: AMD Family 10h Opteron Bandwidth_

The first detail one notices about the numbers is that the processor is capable of handling two instructions per cycle if the L1d cache is sufficient. The read performance exceeds 32 bytes per cycle and even the write performance is, with 18.7 bytes per cycle, high. The read curve flattens quickly, though, and is, with 2.3 bytes per cycle, pretty low. The processor for this test does not prefetch any data, at least not efficiently.

The write curve on the other hand performs according to the sizes of the various caches. The peak performance is achieved for the full size of the L1d, going down to 6 bytes per cycle for L2, to 2.8 bytes per cycle for L3, and finally .5 bytes per cycle if not even L3 can hold all the data. The performance for the L1d cache exceeds that of the (older) Core 2 processor, the L2 access is equally fast (with the Core 2 having a larger cache), and the L3 and main memory access is slower.

The copy performance cannot be better than either the read or write performance. This is why we see the curve initially dominated by the read performance and later by the write performance.

The multi-thread performance of the Opteron processor is shown in Figure 3.29.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.65.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.29: AMD Fam 10h Bandwidth with 2 Threads_

The read performance is largely unaffected. Each thread's L1d and L2 works as before and the L3 cache is in this case not prefetched very well either. The two threads do not unduly stress the L3 for their purpose. The big problem in this test is the write performance. All data the threads share has to go through the L3 cache. This sharing seems to be quite inefficient since even if the L3 cache size is sufficient to hold the entire working set the cost is significantly higher than an L3 access. Comparing this graph with Figure 3.27 we see that the two threads of the Core 2 processor operate at the speed of the shared L2 cache for the appropriate range of working set sizes. This level of performance is achieved for the Opteron processor only for a very small range of the working set sizes and even here it approaches _only_ the speed of the L3 which is slower than the Core 2's L2.

**3.5.2 Critical Word Load**

Memory is transferred from the main memory into the caches in blocks which are smaller than the cache line size. Today 64 _bits_ are transferred at once and the cache line size is 64 or 128 _bytes_. This means 8 or 16 transfers per cache line are needed.

The DRAM chips can transfer those 64-bit blocks in burst mode. This can fill the cache line without any further commands from the memory controller and the possibly associated delays. If the processor prefetches cache lines this is probably the best way to operate.

If a program's cache access of the data or instruction caches misses (that means, it is a compulsory cache miss, because the data is used for the first time, or a capacity cache miss, because the limited cache size requires eviction of the cache line) the situation is different. The word inside the cache line which is required for the program to continue might not be the first word in the cache line. Even in burst mode and with double data rate transfer the individual 64-bit blocks arrive at noticeably different times. Each block arrives 4 CPU cycles or more later than the previous one. If the word the program needs to continue is the eighth of the cache line, the program has to wait an additional 30 cycles or more after the first word arrives.

Things do not necessarily have to be like this. The memory controller is free to request the words of the cache line in a different order. The processor can communicate which word the program is waiting on, the _critical word_, and the memory controller can request this word first. Once the word arrives the program can continue while the rest of the cache line arrives and the cache is not yet in a consistent state. This technique is called Critical Word First & Early Restart.

Processors nowadays implement this technique but there are situations when that is not possible. If the processor prefetches data the critical word is not known. Should the processor request the cache line during the time the prefetch operation is in flight it will have to wait until the critical word arrives without being able to influence the order.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.72.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.30: Critical Word at End of Cache Line_

Even with these optimizations in place the position of the critical word on a cache line matters. Figure 3.30 shows the Follow test for sequential and random access. Shown is the slowdown of running the test with the pointer which is chased in the first word versus the case when the pointer is in the last word. The element size is 64 bytes, corresponding the cache line size. The numbers are quite noisy but it can be seen that, as soon as the L2 is not sufficient to hold the working set size, the performance of the case where the critical word is at the end is about 0.7% slower. The sequential access appears to be affected a bit more. This would be consistent with the aforementioned problem when prefetching the next cache line.

**3.5.3 Cache Placement**

Where the caches are placed in relationship to the hyper-threads, cores, and processors is not under control of the programmer. But programmers can determine where the threads are executed and then it becomes important how the caches relate to the used CPUs.

Here we will not go into details of when to select what cores to run the threads. We will only describe architecture details which the programmer has to take into account when setting the affinity of the threads.

Hyper-threads, by definition share everything but the register set. This includes the L1 caches. There is not much more to say here. The fun starts with the individual cores of a processor. Each core has at least its own L1 caches. Aside from this there are today not many details in common:

  * Early multi-core processors had separate L2 caches and no higher caches. 
  * Later Intel models had shared L2 caches for dual-core processors. For quad-core processors we have to deal with separate L2 caches for each pair of two cores. There are no higher level caches. 
  * AMD's family 10h processors have separate L2 caches and a unified L3 cache. 

A lot has been written in the propaganda material of the processor vendors about the advantage of their respective models. Separate L2 caches have an advantage if the working sets handled by the cores do not overlap. This works well for single-threaded programs. Since this is still often the reality today this approach does not perform too badly. But there is always some overlap. The caches all contain the most actively used parts of the common runtime libraries which means some cache space is wasted.

Completely sharing all caches beside L1 as Intel's dual-core processors do can have a big advantage. If the working set of the threads working on the two cores overlaps significantly the total available cache memory is increased and working sets can be bigger without performance degradation. If the working sets do not overlap Intel's Advanced Smart Cache management is supposed to prevent any one core from monopolizing the entire cache.

If both cores use about half the cache for their respective working sets there is some friction, though. The cache constantly has to weigh the two cores' cache use and the evictions performed as part of this rebalancing might be chosen poorly. To see the problems we look at the results of yet another test program.

> ![](https://static.lwn.net/images/cpumemory/cpumemory.74.png)
> 
> > _Figure 3.31: Bandwidth with two Processes_

The test program has one process constantly reading or writing, using SSE instructions, a 2MB block of memory. 2MB was chosen because this is half the size of the L2 cache of this Core 2 processor. The process is pinned to one core while a second process is pinned to the other core. This second process reads and writes a memory region of variable size. The graph shows the number of bytes per cycle which are read or written. Four different graphs are shown, one for each combination of the processes reading and writing. The read/write graph is for the background process, which always uses a 2MB working set to write, and the measured process with variable working set to read.

The interesting part of the graph is the part between 220 and 223 bytes. If the L2 cache of the two cores were completely separate we could expect that the performance of all four tests would drop between 221 and 222 bytes, that means, once the L2 cache is exhausted. As we can see in Figure 3.31 this is not the case. For the cases where the background process is writing this is most visible. The performance starts to deteriorate before the working set size reaches 1MB. The two processes do not share memory and therefore the processes do not cause RFO messages to be generated. These are pure cache eviction problems. The smart cache handling has its problems with the effect that the experienced cache size per core is closer to 1MB than the 2MB per core which are available. One can only hope that, if caches shared between cores remain a feature of upcoming processors, the algorithm used for the smart cache handling will be fixed.

Having a quad-core processor with two L2 caches was just a stop-gap solution before higher-level caches could be introduced. This design provides no significant performance advantage over separate sockets and dual-core processors. The two cores communicate via the same bus which is, at the outside, visible as the FSB. There is no special fast-track data exchange.

The future of cache design for multi-core processors will lie in more layers. AMD's 10h family of processors make the start. Whether we will continue to see lower level caches be shared by a subset of the cores of a processor remains to be seen. The extra levels of cache are necessary since the high-speed and frequently used caches cannot be shared among many cores. The performance would be impacted. It would also require very large caches with high associativity. Both numbers, the cache size and the associativity, must scale with the number of cores sharing the cache. Using a large L3 cache and reasonably-sized L2 caches is a reasonable trade-off. The L3 cache is slower but it is ideally not as frequently used as the L2 cache.

For programmers all these different designs mean complexity when making scheduling decisions. One has to know the workloads and the details of the machine architecture to achieve the best performance. Fortunately we have support to determine the machine architecture. The interfaces will be introduced in later sections.

**3.5.4 FSB Influence**

The FSB plays a central role in the performance of the machine. Cache content can only be stored and loaded as quickly as the connection to the memory allows. We can show how much so by running a program on two machines which only differ in the speed of their memory modules. Figure 3.32 shows the results of the Addnext0 test (adding the content of the next elements pad[0] element to the own pad[0] element) for NPAD=7 on a 64-bit machine. Both machines have Intel Core 2 processors, the first uses 667MHz DDR2 modules, the second 800MHz modules (a 20% increase).

The numbers show that, when the FSB is really stressed for large working set sizes, we indeed see a large benefit. The maximum performance increase measured in this test is 18.2%, close to the theoretical maximum. What this shows is that a faster FSB indeed can pay off big time. It is not critical when the working set fits into the caches (and these processors have a 4MB L2). It must be kept in mind that we are measuring one program here. The working set of a system comprises the memory needed by all concurrently running processes. This way it is easily possible to exceed 4MB memory or more with much smaller programs.

Today some of Intel's processors support FSB speeds up to 1,333MHz which would mean another 60% increase. The future is going to see even higher speeds. If speed is important and the working set sizes are larger, fast RAM and high FSB speeds are certainly worth the money. One has to be careful, though, since even though the processor might support higher FSB speeds the motherboard/Northbridge might not. It is critical to check the specifications.
