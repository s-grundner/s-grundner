Software development books are a great source of knowledge and wisdom. But unfortunately, there are very few people reading books today, especially programmers. Most often they rely on the internet search results to find answers.

But, if you're a software developer, you need to read more books, because software development is not only about coding, it is about thinking, it is about best practices. And books give you a good explanation and base, that you won't always find in short articles or Google search results.

At [Apiumhub](https://apiumhub.com/), we are big fans of reading good literature, we even have a small library in the office with our favorite software development books. Today, we created a list of books we believe may help any kind of developer become a better professional. And here you have a list of top 20 software development books that are worth mentioning in this article.

##  Top 20 Software Development Books to Read

1\. [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, Don Roberts, Erich Gamma](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasonroell600-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201485672&linkId=273488cbe8d54d8ad4441197e5326762)

This book is the first one in the list of top software development books and it is written by very well known software development influencers. It is basically about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, it improves its internal structure.

With refactoring, you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. In this book, you will find discussions about principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works. Readers of the book will come away with a more mature, more long-term perspective about what constitutes good design.

2\. [Camel in Action by Claus Ibsen and Jonathan Anstey](https://www.amazon.com/Camel-Action-Claus-Ibsen/dp/1935182366)

_Camel in Action_ is a Camel tutorial full of small examples showing how to work with the integration patterns. It starts with core concepts like sending, receiving, routing, and transforming data. It then shows you the entire lifecycle and goes in depth on how to test, deal with errors, scale, deploy, and even monitor your app - details you can find only in the Camel code itself. Written by the developers of Camel, this book distills their experience and practical insights so that you can tackle integration tasks like a pro.

3\. [Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Tom-DeMarco/dp/0932633439)

This book is not about programming, it is about management and motivation. And it is in almost all the lists of software development books to read! It's a great read for developers, as, very often, developers, especially inexperienced ones, don't understand the thought process of management. The authors explain how managers can enable their software teams to realize their potential in a sustainable manner. In this book, you may discover a lot of helpful tips on how to put more quality into a product, etc.

4\. [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Grady Booch ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasonroell600-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201633612&linkId=a8396a795d3cc9a04acf269ef5c88eab)

If you are a software architect or a software developer, this book is highly recommended to read.
