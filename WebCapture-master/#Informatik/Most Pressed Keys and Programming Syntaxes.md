# Most Pressed Keys and Programming Syntaxes

_Captured: 2015-09-21 at 22:21 from [www.mahdiyusuf.com](http://www.mahdiyusuf.com/post/9947002105/most-pressed-keys-and-programming-syntaxes-2)_

I switch between programming languages quite a bit; I often wondered what happens when having to deal with the different syntaxes, does the syntax allow you to be more expressive or faster at coding in one language or another. I dont really know about that; but what I do know what keys are pressed when writing with different programming languages.

This might be something interesting for people who are deciding to select a programming language might look into, here is a [post](http://www.mahdiyusuf.com/post/3279728032/solved-what-programming-languages-should-i-learn) on the answer to the aged question of: Which programming language should I learn?

As far as I can tell languages with a wider focused spread across the keyboard are usually syntaxes we usually associate with [ugly languages](http://www.mahdiyusuf.com/post/3509358586/which-programming-languages-make-you-cuss-more) (ugly to read and code). _ex. shell and perl._

You might argue that the variables names being used will alter the results, but as most languages programming have conventions for naming but we can assume a decent spread for variable names. I don't offer conclusions, just poorly layout the facts. Although the heat map does miss out on things like shift and caps. _ex. in perl with the dollar sign. ($)_

_[Whitespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_\(programming_language) hasn't been taken into consideration (tabs and spaces) which would have been a cool thing to see. _

The data that was used to gather this information was spread amongst various popular Github projects.
