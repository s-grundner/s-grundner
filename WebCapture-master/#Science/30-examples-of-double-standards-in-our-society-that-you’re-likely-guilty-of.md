_**A [double standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard) is the application of different sets of principles for similar situations. They may take the form of an instance in which certain concepts (often, for example, a word, phrase, social norm, or rule) are perceived as acceptable to be applied by one group of people, but are considered unacceptable--taboo--when applied by another group.**_

([CE](https://www.collective-evolution.com/)) In modern society today, many of us are seeking to attain, or better yet, create equality on various levels for all. Though our attempt and intent to change the way we perceive, care for or act towards one another are evident, we are still far from achieving true equality amongst ourselves. Part of this is due to how we are approaching the situation.

Below are some images that further illustrate the double standards that we face today. Whether of gender, race, physical build, geographic location, or anything else that is typically out of our control - it is important to note that though we may be guilty of these double standards ourselves, as we take notice of them we can then create awareness around such, and expand our consciousness beyond the programming and stories set in our minds currently.

We cannot raise awareness nor work towards shifting our collective consciousness by building up one race, gender, or any one thing whilst bashing on another - as that would merely shift 'blame' and ultimately not provide the change we are looking for. We must take the time to reflect and realize why or what we may have been doing in order to learn and grow from that very realization & awareness.

We are being faced with the challenge of truly asking ourselves who we are. What that means is much more than trying to define ourselves by something like clothing, culture, gender etc. These are simply added aspects of our experience, but not our entire experience. The more we get caught up in these identities and illusions, the more we suffer and divide. While the push for this division is strong in media right now, it also serves as a chance to see everything we are not, so we can find out who we truly are.

It's about self awareness, reflection, neutrality and love.

Remember, we are all magical beings, stardust.. the Universe itself living out a human experience. We experience so that we may become more aligned, in-tune and aware of our Self, and through this gained clarity we form a deeper understanding of our purpose here and an innerstanding of our connection to everyone else.

If you are reading this, take this as a light-hearted reminder to not judge, but to take notice. Whether this is in regards to others or of ourselves and our own thoughts & actions - we must remember to be loving and open. Release past programming, stories, and thoughts, and realize we are so much more than we have been led to believe - we are more than our genders, races, and all physicality..

_**You are the Universe; it's pronounced 'YOU'niverse for a reason.**_
