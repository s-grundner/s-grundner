In the past several years, a certain genre of illustration has emerged on the Internet and it is spread through news articles like this one. Sort of like the modern day version of newspaper cartoons but more graphic and varying in content thanks to the internet, a new genre of illustration is here.

In this article, you'll find 22 illustrations that place humans in the position that animals are currently in: being harvested for everything they have, living their lives like this constantly.

This one is disturbing on a few different levels. We're being harvested as human beings with the monetary system and wage slavery already, we're not the only ones doing the harvesting: it's more like, people at the very top of the human power pyramid force the rest of humanity to harvest the other animals. Of course, some people do it out of their own volition as well.

This one is creepy, look at those little human beings. What if some other creatures exist on Earth that harvest some kind of energy from our emotions and we can't even see them? Who says we are the biggest predator?
