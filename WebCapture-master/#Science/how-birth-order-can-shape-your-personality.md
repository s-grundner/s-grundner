You must have heard from someone that the oldest kid in a family tends to be very responsible, while children who have no siblings are far more likely to be selfish and demanding. Are these merely stereotypes, or is it really true that our birth order can shape our personality?

Today we at **Bright Side** have decided to find the answer to this intriguing question.

The birth order theory began in the late 1920s with Alfred Adler, Sigmund Freudâ€™s friend and colleague. **Adler believed that the order in which you are born into a family inherently affects your personality. **

  * **The first-born (oldest) child.** According to Adler, the oldest child tends to be conservative, power-oriented, and predisposed toward leadership. Because they often take responsibility for their younger siblings, firstborns grow up to be caring, more willing to become parents, and more likely to take initiative.
  * **The second (middle) child. **Since the older brother or sister is a "pace-setter" for the second child, they often struggle to surpass their older sibling. The pace of development is higher. The middle kids in a family often tend to be ambitious, but they are rarely selfish. They are also more likely to set unreasonably high goals for themselves. This increases the number of failures, however knowing how to cope with difficulties in life is what makes them stronger.
  * **The last-born (youngest) child. **As a rule, the youngest child gets a lot of care and attention from parents and even older siblings. That is why they may feel less experienced and independent. However, last-borns are usually highly motivated to surpass their older sisters and brothers. Very often they achieve a big success and earn recognition in their chosen field. They become the fastest athletes, the best musicians, or the most talented artists. The youngest children in a family tend to be very sociable, though they are likely to be more irresponsible and frivolous than older children.
  * **The only child.** Without any siblings to compete with, the only child often competes with his or her father. Being overly pampered by their parents, the single kid expects pampering and protection from all others too. Dependency and self-centeredness are the leading qualities of this style of life. The only child often has difficulty interacting with peers. Many children who have no siblings become perfectionists, and they tend to achieve their goals no matter what.
