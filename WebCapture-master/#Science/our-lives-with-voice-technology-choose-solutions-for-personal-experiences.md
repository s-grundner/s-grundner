**Different Experiences Require Different Voice Solutions**

Walking in the rain, I so wished my best friend was with me to experience the beauty of the red and yellow leaves in the mist. How could I capture my thoughts at that moment to share with her? Easy; I remembered that I was wearing my new water-proof [Senstone](http://senstone.io/) snapped to my collar. I click my Senstone as easy as [Captain Kirk tapped his communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicator_%28Star_Trek%29). I speak to my computer. Instant. Easy. Artificial Intelligence. Capturing my thoughts.

I felt lucky because without a Senstone, the effort would have been tedious -- keep walking until a dry spot was reached, open leather mobile phone wallet, open voice app or text app, yada yada yada as Elaine on Seinfeld would say.

Is Senstone voice assistant with artificial intelligence from [Senstone.io](http://senstone.io/) the solution for every experience for every person? No.

When we consider voice devices to use, it comes down to Objective + Situation + Experience Desired.

While smartphones with voice assistants (Siri, Google Now) offer/ed a voice recording, the main wish customers have is to avoid "taking phone out". It is the main friction point. Looking for the ways to input or record information, thereby looking away from people and traffic is the next friction point. And, it's not all about autos. Are you a pedestrian, scooter and Segway rider, bicyclist, snow skier, caterpillar operator, equestrian, or back-country hiker?

We all need different solutions at different times. I think it's a bit much to say, "In an ideal world we would have just one solution." Because, not everyone wants just one. Choice can be a good thing.

Since I love researching technology and sharing what I learn, here is a simple breakout of voice solutions and when best to use them.
