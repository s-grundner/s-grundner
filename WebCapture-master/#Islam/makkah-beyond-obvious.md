## As flabbergasting as Golden ratio itself is

### There may be number of miracles associated with the city of Hijaz in one or other way but i dont want to prove my predilection towards it as i myself belong to the religion of Islam.But there is something which no can deny,because of everyone having faith in Science of abstract things precisely mathematics ,we might have learnt before the Golden Ratio("phi") or maybe the number 1.61803398875 may have striked us before,and knowing the beauty behind it in almost everything we notice from the DNA spirals to the topology of universe .

### What fascinates a person is that the city of makkah mathematically is the golden mean point or the golden ratio point of the earth .i.e the ratio of distances between the north pole and Makkah and the distance from Makka to south pole is the golden ratio "phi" moreover the ratio of distances between Makkah and south pole and the distances between north pole and south pole is again the divine section or golden ratio ,the ratio between eastern and western elongation of the city is again the same number ,we have not finished yet if the earth is redrawn as a two dimensional sheet ,the golden rectangle will again point us towards the city of Makkah. This sequence of events which have left us dumbfounded is not because of the number itself but we wonder why Makkah ,why every time Makkah why? !!!!!
