I was told the other day that Agile only works for web development. And guess what, the guy was right.

Agile only works for web development, and…

### Developing Cars

[Wikispeed](http://wikispeed.org) is an automotive manufacturer that develops cars through modular design. The company was founded by Joe Justice to produce a car that would compete for the Progressive Automotive X Prize competition in 2010. They came in 10th place, no mean feat given they were competing with major world wide car manufacturers. Wikispeed uses Scrum development techniques to improve productivity and development of their cars. Though Wikispeed is a small car manufacturer run by volunteers, they are making ripples in the car industry with their rapid development times.

The Toyota Production System is the basis for Lean, which is the basis for Agile development. Toyota has been in the Agile game for over 70 years. They are now the [third largest car manufacturer.](http://fortune.com/2017/07/28/renault-nissan-largest-automaker/)

### Education

[eduScrum](http://eduscrum.nl) is a version of Scrum modified for education in schools. Developed in the Netherlands, it teachs kids to be self organizing of their learning. Students plan and determine their own activities and keep track of their own progress. The instructor determines the assignments, coaches, and gives advice. Students that work under eduScrum have better grades and a better understanding of material than their non-Scrum counterparts.

### Law

[Lonely Planet](https://vimeo.com/78853292), the company that develops travel books of the same name, has a legal team here in Melbourne which uses Agile techniques to manage their workload.

### A Whole Town

[Grow Cornwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoxxsfXsulQ&feature=youtu.be) is an experiment for a town in Cornwall, England to introduce Agile techniques to businesses. The process has helped companies and businesses improve their workflow, throughput and thus profit.

### Law Enforcement

The [Ghana Police Service](http://www.information-age.com/solving-one-ghanas-biggest-challenges-agile-framework-123469057/) began adopting Scrum practices for its police force in January 2017 to become a world class police service. Their goal is to become one of the top 10 police services worldwide in 4 years' time. With roughly 33,000 police offices and an additional 14,000 community support officers, the task isn't easy, but they have taken up the challenge.

[Tenfold](https://www.tenfold.com/sales-leadership/agile-sales-teams) is a software company that has applied Agile to their sales processes.

### Manufacturing

[Agile manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_manufacturing) means that things have come full circle. Using techniques from Agile, companies are applying these techniques to manufacturing and are seen to be taking Lean Manufacturing to the next level.

Yep, Agile only works with Web Development - NOT!

Let me know in the comments if you have any other examples of Agile use outside the IT Sector.
