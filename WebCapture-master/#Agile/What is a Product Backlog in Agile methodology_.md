# What is a Product Backlog in Agile methodology?

The product backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in  
the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made  
to the product.

At its core, the product backlog is an ordered list of items that is managed by a  
person with the ability to understand the business needs.  
The product backlog is used to:  
capture requests for modifying a product. This can include add new features,  
replacing old features, removing features and fixing issues; and  
ensure the delivery team is given work which maximizes the business benefit to  
the owner of the product

The term "product backlog" comes from the Agile method, Scrum.

## Product Backlog Items

A product backlog contains a list of product backlog items. Scrum doesn't define what a  
product backlog item is.

We've found that focusing on a product's capabilities, rather than work tasks, keeps the  
backlog goal-oriented.  
When items are goal-oriented they focus on the "what" rather than the "how". For those  
familiar with traditional project management, the product backlog is more like the product  
breakdown structure than a work breakdown structure.

It's pretty common to have items in the form of:

  * user stories - representing new functionality; and
  * bugs - representing work to address a defect.

Over time you may be a bit more sophisticated an add in:

  * chores - representing work that must be done, but provide no direct business value
  * epics - representing big user stories. Originally defined as too big to fit in an
  * iteration (the equivalent of a Scrum sprint).
  * prototypes (a form of risk mitigation) - representing proof of concepts that help

provide information for decision making around whether some functionality may be valuable.

There really are no hard rules on what an item should be called. Keeping all items  
customer-oriented, rather than couched in terms of the delivery team will keep your  
backlog focused on making a product that delivers the most amount of business value.

The smallest items, stories, should be a small enough for the team to complete within an  
iteration. There are no rules for the larger items.

### Who is responsible and accountable?

Scrum advocates that the role of Product Owner be assigned. The Product Owner is responsible  
for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. The Product  
Owner gathers input, takes feedback and is lobbied by many people, but it will ultimately  
make the call on what gets built. They are also solely responsible for the management of the backlog.
