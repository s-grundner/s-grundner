What do a personal computer, a supermarket, and clothing apparel all have in common?

Answer: the concept of modular design.

In simple terms, modular design subdivides a larger system into smaller independent parts or modules. The modules then become discrete parts that get plugged in and out of a larger system or platform.

What's important about this approach is that you can integrate the modules according to your particular design preferences or needs. For example, you can swap out an old computer hard drive with a new one without having to buy a new computer. Supermarkets can take one product off the shelf and replace it with another more profitable one without having to change the whole store. And you can mix and match clothing apparel and accessories to change the look of an outfit.

This kind of thinking - modular thinking -- is the basis for mass customization.

#### modular thinking versus industrial age thinking 

Modular thinking differs from the thinking that dominated the industrial age, with its mass production of standardized goods based on a single product design. Back then, efficiency stemmed from reducing the variety of parts that needed to be produced and assembled.

The downside of this mindset is that it translated into few product choices and a "what you see is what you get" proposition for customers. Hence, Henry Ford's rumored quip about the Model T, when he reportedly said, "You can have it in any color as long as it's black." It is noteworthy to mention that this mindset endured right up until to the early 1980's.

#### the ascent of modular thinking 

Near the end of the industrial age, people began to look hard at doing the exact reverse by asking if a product might be broken down into component parts that could be mixed and matched together, and yet still rein in the costs of producing it?

The reason for entertaining this question rested with the recognition that, if it could be done, it would create new value by offering the benefit of making the product customizable. Individual customers could fashion it into whatever they desired rather than have to take - or leave - what the manufacturer decided to offer.

If that happened, then the locus of control would shift over to the customer, and the providers of products and services would have to become "customer-centric" instead of "product-centric." That one change in mindset alone would invariably work to benefit the customer.

#### the answer 

The answer to this question, it turned out, lay not in creating a product per se, but in creating a system or architectural design that allowed the mixing and matching of components into the specific configurations preferred by the individual customers. This realization marked the rise of modular design.

Modular design permits customization combined with cost containment -- because you can change or modify a module without having to modify the larger system or platform. For example, you can install and uninstall all sorts of software on one operating system such as a Mac or Windows platform. By the time everyone has finished doing this, it's conceivable no two desktops will look exactly alike.

Professor of Strategy and Technology Management Ron Sanchez says, "Businesses need to create product and process architectures that are capable of providing the flexibility to customize products for individuals and to upgrade them when better components come along." I would add that the same holds true for services as well.

#### specialization and systemization 

Modular thinking strategically combines specialization with systemization. At the module level, for instance, there will often likely be a reliance on specialization. For example, the Intel processor is a specialized part that can be plugged in to many different brands of computers. Similarly, a small business may need expert guidance from an accountant or lawyer on a contingency basis rather than as part of the regular staff.

At the system level, strategy will dictate how the specialized modules are interfaced or plugged together to create the larger whole. Thereafter, the system will change only to the extent that changes in the individual modules or pieces alter it. This kind of flexibility, when aligned with low costs, broadens the horizon for creating value.

#### the value chain for marketing 

The [value chain for marketing ](http://marketing-strategy-management.com/2010/02/a-value-chain-approach-part-2/)encourages modular thinking for managing value creation across time. Some components of it might be tweaked to increase the benefits offered while others might be used to lower costs. For example, some marketing activities might be outsourced rather than handled in-house, if it is more strategically sound to do so.

The various combinations of value creating opportunities that are available as one moves across the chain, via the mixing and matching of the pieces, can produce different scenarios of value creation. I'll explore the different [scenarios for value creation ](http://marketing-strategy-management.com/2010/03/4-value-creating-scenarios/)in the next post.

The last post, "[Creating Value with Modular Thinking](http://marketing-strategy-management.com/2010/03/creating-value-with-modular-thinking/)," discusses how the principles of modular design apply to the concept of creating value for customers, and how the [generic value chain for marketing ](http://marketing-strategy-management.com/2010/02/a-value-chain-approach-part-2/)encourages modular thinking to effectively manage value creation across time.

This post outlines some of the key value creating scenarios likely to be explored when using the value chain for marketing.

#### the value creating scenarios

Throughout this blog, I interchangeably use terms like "components" and "modules" to describe the different parts of the generic value chain for marketing. Regardless of the term used, let me reiterate that value can be created from within an individual component or it can be enhanced by strengthening the relationships between components. In each case, the added value comes from making a change either in the perceived benefits, the cost, or possibly both. This will hold true regardless of whether it happens within a component or in the relationship between components.

With that in mind, the four most probable value creating scenarios, as shown in the diagram above, are:

  1. The perceived benefits are increased, the costs remain the same, and the value goes up.
  2. The perceived benefits remain the same, the costs are reduced, and the value goes up.
  3. The perceived benefits go up, the costs go up, and the value may or may not go up (see discussion below).
  4. The perceived benefits go up, the costs go down, and the value goes up. 

#### external forces

The external forces will have a significant role in determining what actually happens with the implementation of any given scenario. This is shown in the lower right hand corner of the above diagram. As you may recall, the generic value chain diagram shows the external forces as exerting an influence on it.

For example, let's say a competitor successfully executes the fourth scenario against your organization's execution of the first one - so that the perceived benefits between the two products remain comparable but now they sell it at a lower price. Under this circumstance, your organization may have increased the value of its product, but it wasn't as much as the competitor was able to do. This creates a possibility for the competition to now have a market advantage.

#### the curious "?" in the third scenario 

Notice the question mark in the value outcome cell for the third scenario? There are several sub-scenarios that can explain this.

For example, it may be a prestige item where some people are willing to pay extra for the brand image because it matches the perceived psychological benefits they get from having it. It therefore derives its value based on the value of the psychological benefits.

Or maybe it's a case where the rise in cost is only marginal and seemingly fair in light of the perceived increase in benefits.

Or maybe there is a basic version of the product line and a deluxe version, and each individual is left to decide which one represents a better value.

Finally, there is the risk that a higher price will overshadow the perceived benefits and the sales of that item will suffer as a result.

Consequently, the third scenario is more likely to unfold in a manner that is distinctly different from the other three, with all else being equal.

#### the two perspectives of value creation

Lastly, there are [two perspectives ](http://marketing-strategy-management.com/2010/03/creating-value-for-customers-two-perspectives/)from which to view these value creating scenarios, and they will come into play when tracking the outcomes against the objectives. I will introduce and explain these two perspectives in the next post.
