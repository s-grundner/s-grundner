Have you ever asked yourself which are the main benefits of Agile over Waterfall? This article contains valuable ideas regarding these 2 sets of methodologies, Waterfall and Agile.

Since 1999, when I started to migrate to Agile values, I continuously learned and applied them into my daily life as an IT professional. Though there are many differences, they can be grouped into few "consequences", as follows.

* Waterfall will bring us poor quality, due to the "expected" lack of time in the testing phase, which the last one;
* Waterfall will bring us poor visibility, due to the specific of Waterfall: we'll see the results at the end of the project;
* Waterfall is too risky, because the project/product is tested at its end, when usually is too late to "deliver working software";
* Waterfall will not respond to change, primarily because the stakeholders believe from the very start that they know what they want and the technical teams have no methods to approach the change, as in Agile.
