### Agile Manifesto 12 principles Explained

This is the part II of our previous post, for the explanation of first six principles of agile manifesto check this post.

Agile measure the progress of team primarily by its software or product that works.

Deliver software that sustain and scale, it educate the team to be self-organized and have constant and sustainable pace.

Team focus more on technology excellence, good design, and agility.

Essentially important to reduce unimportant tasks and limiting work in progress.

Empower the team so it will deliver the best design, architecture and quality software.

Self-organize team doesn't just deliver a quality software, it regularly tune and adjust to itself, applying change management for improvement.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 7

> **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

#### Important takeaway (agile manifesto explanation)

**[Working software]**

**[primary measure]**

**[progress]**

The most important measure for business should be working software. As a happy customer is a result of working software, instead of focusing in unnecessary QA, sales and productivity metrics we should measure on value, listening to customer satisfaction, as this is what defined to be a working software. This also tells how well is the progress of the team.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 8

> **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

#### Important takeaway (agile manifesto explanation)

**[Sustainable development]   
[constant pace]**

The important reason of team so hurry in adopting agile is to have sustainability and scalibity in their product, as it just cut through the waste. Making everone to work with constant pace continuously, meaning with in with fixed set of scope to achieve it, collectively as ateam of sponsors, devloper and manager.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 9

> **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

To gain agility, we should give more emphasis on design and technical excellence as nothing else really matters.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 10

> **Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.**

#### Important takeaway (agile manifesto explanation)

**[Simplicity]  
[work not done]**

It's essential and simple to identify the amount of unimportant work and eliminate it to have a clear visibility for team, it's reducing waste, removing impediments and limiting work in progress, but its a art which should be learn by doing it.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 11

> **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

Self organized team deliver the best architecture, fully refined requirements and design, team here is a project team which includes dev team, product owner, scrum master and stakeholder.

### Agile Manifesto Principle 12

> **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

#### Important takeaway (agile manifesto explanation)

Apply the improvement process activities like the retrospective and other activities more often. Self-organise team tune to itself and do the sanity check regularly. As project situation and realities keep changing, it's not only process improvement but the team need to adjust its behavior to any change circumstance. Assuming that sprint scope keep on changing, it could be frustrating, but the team needs to understand that those changes are directly coming from customers, it affect heavily on the value proposition and revenue stream.
