So, you're a development team member on a Scrum Team. We know that can sometimes be a little overwhelming. I've been in the business for more than a decade and yet the amount of change and dedication that top-notch software development requires is still daunting to me. With this in mind, my team and I have gone through our database of resources and pulled out what we think is the most relevant, useful information that you need to know to be effective in an Agile development team and to excel. There are lots to learn if you are new, but a book a month and a link a week is a good pace. Call us if we can help. Good luck on your Agile journey!

## Stuff Every Agile Development Team Needs to Know: A Primer

### Start Here

Whether you're looking at hardware, software or the people who make both of these work, if it's Agile you'll have a hard time finding a better, more comprehensive library of resources. We have lots of material, mostly in easy to consume pieces. Some of my favorites include:
