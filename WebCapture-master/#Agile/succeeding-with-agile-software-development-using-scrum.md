Starting the transition to an agile development process like Scrum is easy; succeeding with Scrum and becoming a genuinely agile organization is harder.

Not only does Scrum introduce new ways of working, it requires new ways of thinking about that work. Becoming agile is an arduous process that, done right, necessitates a mindset shift not only for individuals and their teams, but also throughout the broader organization. Succeeding with Agile provides actionable insight to help organizations overcome the challenges that can and will arise in the wake of these changes.

From leading agile author, consultant, and practitioner, Mike Cohn, Succeeding with Agile shows both how to get started and then how to get good at Scrum. The author illuminates all teaching points with helpful tips, advice on overcoming common objections, exercises to try, and anecdotes drawn from over a decade of experience helping companies succeed with Scrum. The result is a book that will be reached for and referenced again and again by all stakeholders in an agile organization.
