Agile development methodology was born out of recognition of the perceived flaws of Waterfall software development. The rigidity of the Waterfall approach played a part in the failure of many projects, including some very high profile ones in the 1990s: the London Stock Exchange, for example, had to abandon its Taurus trading system after several years of work. It is estimated that £75 million was lost by the London Stock Exchange, and as much as £400 million by other stakeholders, as a result.

Traditional IT project management methods, sometimes called Waterfall methods, force every development stage to be subject to extensive documentation and approval. This rigour (which is nevertheless an improvement on the complete free-for-all of the earliest IT projects) comes at the expense of flexibility. It becomes harder to adapt to changing requirements - and requirements on a big project nearly always change. A small alteration can involve adjusting the entire hierarchy of design documents, functional and non-functional specifications, development plans, budgets, and more. In some cases, obtaining something as theoretically simple as customer signoff can take up much of the development process - and customers can sometimes change their minds right up to the very end of a project.

Agile development is a reaction to the failure of this traditional approach. If a Waterfall project is a super tanker - large, ungainly, and difficult to steer - then an Agile project is supposed to be a motorboat: nimbler, more adaptable, and able to navigate obstacles with relative ease. But there are many different kinds of motorboat, and there are many different variations of this methodology. All have unique strengths and weaknesses, and some will be more suited to your team than others.

Here are the five main Agile development methodologies - and a breakdown of their advantages and disadvantages.

**Scrum**  
Scrum is the most popular variation of the Agile development methodology, especially for software development projects as opposed to other types of IT projects such as major change - upgrades and migrations, for example. Scrum is characterised by three key elements: roles, artifacts, and time boxes.

Roles outline duties and responsibilities, artifacts provide information about completed and pending activities, and time boxes set limits on the amount of time a certain task can take. The time box most closely associated with Scrum is the 'sprint' - a one month (or less) period after which all completed elements of the software are delivered to the customer for review and acceptance, irrespective of whether or not the whole product is completed. A Scrum project is organised as a series of sprints.

There are three key Scrum roles:

The product owner is a single individual designed to represent the customer: the product owner decides on whether requirements have been met or not and sets priorities for development, e.g. which functionality to implement first. The product owner is expected to represent the views of different stakeholders within the customer organisation. If there are a lot of stakeholders, the product owner must spend a lot of time communicating with them so as to represent their views accurately to the development team. The product owner is a key figure because they allow the development team to interact with a single authoritative customer representative, rather than an unwieldy collection of stakeholders which may take a long time to make decisions and approve delivered items.

The Scrum master co-ordinates the efforts of the development team. The Scrum master is a kind of team coach: organising team meetings, assisting the product owner with prioritising development by indicating the effort required for and the practical constraints on each piece of development. The Scrum master also seeks to remove obstacles to progress and is generally responsible for team cohesion - even though he or she doesn't manage anyone directly.

The development team is everyone else: working with the Scrum master and product owner, it is responsible for analysis, coding, testing, deployment, and everything else involved in the incremental development process.

There are four key Scrum artifacts. The product backlog is a repository of work to be done. It contains all the tasks which the customer would like to be done, even though the effort required to complete them all may exceed the available resources. It is an evolving entity and its contents take the form of 'user stories', which contain descriptions of elements of functionality which the customer would like to be implemented in the product. The sprint backlog is a list of the stories which have been chosen for development in the current sprint. As the sprint progresses, the stories are finished.

This is tracked by the burn-down chart, which plots over time the pending (or remaining) work in the sprint backlog. Ideally the chart should read zero by the end of each sprint. The increment is the collective number of all product backlog items completed during a sprint.

The core advantages of Scrum are that it allows for software development to react more rapidly to changes in the requirements, and, by early and frequent running and testing of the software, flushes out bugs more quickly (the earlier a bug is discovered, the quicker and cheaper it is to fix). Making a change, fixing a bug, or discarding an unsuitable feature will often be the work of days or weeks rather than months. This means higher quality software is often delivered in less time.

Criticisms of Scrum include that the approach does not lend itself to meeting fixed deadlines, which makes it harder to meet long-term goals. Scrum does not prescribe the creation of full documentation on the product, so when the project is over and the team disperses, maintenance of the product can be difficult if there is insufficient documentation. It can also be difficult to perform large-scale projects: there is a low limit to the number of developers who can be managed effectively by a single Scrum master. That said, there are ways to address these criticisms, for example creating stories in the backlog which require written documentation. Consequently, over many years of real-world use, Scrum has become the leading method of software development.

**Extreme Programming**  
Extreme Programming (XP) originated around the same time as Scrum and has much in common with it, but there are crucial differences. A team using XP collaborates closely to ensure all coding is consistent and that the system is continuously integrated. Code is iterated and improved upon constantly to meet customer requirements.

This is not altogether too different from the Scrum approach. But where a dedicated Scrum team will work in fortnight-month long sprints, an XP team will work in sprints that are a maximum of one-two weeks long. Where the Scrum team will dictate the order in which product backlog items are worked on, an XP team will work according to the product owner's hierarchy of priorities. Where Scrum teams will not allow their sprints to be modified, XP development allows for the easy swapping of features.

The principal advantage of the XP agile development methodology is the way it brings engineering-style discipline to the process of software development. This often leads to high levels of quality. Indeed, XP is also closely linked to test-driven development (TDD), in which a test is written for every story before the code for the story is written. TDD has been successful in many projects, but in some situations, the time required to write tests in advance for every story is not justified by the benefit.

**Kanban**  
The term Kanban originated from Toyota's "just in time" manufacturing techniques. Kanban software development adapts and applies to IT many of the concepts pioneered by Toyota in its manufacturing process. Kanban is closely related to lean management techniques (see below) which were also developed from Toyota's processes. Kanban is like Scrum and XP in the way that it adopts an iterative, incremental method of development. However, it is unlike Scrum and XP in other ways. It does not have sprints and it allows specific deadlines to be put on tasks. The rate of work is controlled by limiting the number of tasks which can be in progress at a time. The bigger the team, the greater the number of tasks which can be handled in parallel.

By limiting the number of simultaneous tasks, Kanban limits the amount of simultaneous change. This then prevents the complexity of change from becoming unmanageable and reduces the risk of error. If done right, more of the work is right first time and the rate of development is greater.

However, a criticism of Kanban is that it does not prescribe Scrum-style retrospectives - where the team discusses what went well and what didn't in the previous sprint, with an eye towards improving on it in the future. Teams using Kanban are necessarily forward looking - which may sometimes prevent them from learning from their mistakes.

**Iterative Development**  
All Agile methods are iterative. Iterative Development is a broad term to describe Agile and other iterative methods not normally perceived as Agile. The term was coined before the term Agile and applies to many progenitor methods of Agile which are now no longer commonly used. Iterative Development methods are often fist-stage refinements of the Waterfall methodology. They are closer to Waterfall's more sequential approach, which can be both good and bad. The crucial difference between Iterative Development and Waterfall development is that coding only begins once each section of the software development phase has been reviewed and agreed upon. Testing doesn't begin until coding is complete. The idea is to segment the software development process into smaller phases, where testing, development, and design are iterated across several repetitive cycles. By doing so, the software is refined until it perfectly suits the customers' needs. This is beneficial to the development team because it allows them to experiment, make improvements and iron out issues without having to make substantial changes to the wider project.

There is no predetermined way to do Iterative Development, which is an advantage and a disadvantage. Each development effort is different, and what is iterated - and the number of things that are to be iterated - will be highly specific to the project and the feedback of the relevant users. Iterative Development can be combined with the Waterfall method relatively easily, which might make it a simpler transition for teams still using it - but a small, inexperienced team will often struggle to make the most of it due to the time and effort required to make many small changes.

**Lean**  
Lean development was also originally inspired by Toyota's manufacturing processes. It emphasises an efficient approach to software development that advances the project without sacrificing speed or quality. It is characterised by seven core tenets:

  1. Elimination of waste
  2. Built-in quality
  3. Creation and curation of knowledge
  4. Commitment to organisational goals
  5. Rapid delivery
  6. Respect for all stakeholders and team members
  7. Efficient production processes

These are at once highly specific and highly general; as with Iterative Development, this is simultaneously for better and worse. Organisational goals, for example, can evolve over time; what is and isn't wasteful can often be subject to internal debate. But the overarching principle - of minimising waste and overheard while maximising speed and quality - is solid, so long as it is applied to the customers' requirements and not innovation and experimentation for its own sake.

**Conclusion**  
Agile development methodology comes in more flavours than the five listed, and more still will be created in future. The common thread to all of them is that they prize flexibility and efficiency, and never work from a strict schematic; they are organised but not rigid; they are collaborative and independent. Whatever method you choose will depend on the makeup of your team - but if you keep these principles in mind, it will be a lot easier to find the one that suits best.
