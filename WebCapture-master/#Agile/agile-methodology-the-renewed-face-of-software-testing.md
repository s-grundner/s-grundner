### Agile development methodologies have changed the world of software. Today, we take a look at how its impacted the field of software testing.

Reduce testing time & get feedback faster through automation.

The Agile Manifesto is not new to the software world. Organizations are adopting the technology in all forms and shapes', aligning their business needs to achieve the ultimate goal of being receptive to the end users and the market needs.

Earlier, just like in other disciplines, the testing teams, too, were indiscriminate with the Agile concepts. However, it is now getting important to ascertain the role of the testing team to fit in with Agile concepts, adoption, timelines, and changing user requirements to where they would really fit in the lifecycle. The testing team has, over the years, gained the most from the varied angles that include the following:

### **Better Reputation for the Work They Do**

The testing team has its own space and accountability and is no longer referred to as a production phase in the software lifecycle. The testers are involved up-front, not just in their testing efforts, but in all other aspects, like defining requirements, production planning, and the design stages. This level of involvement enhances their skills and brings out their best.

### **Improved Work With the Best Approaches**

With a special focus on automation testing to save the test cycles, the testers have had some tasks taken off their plates which had previously been done manually. This has given testers more time to think and do bigger and better things.

### **Great Collaboration and Full Involvement With the Whole Team**

Shifting to the left of the SDLC allows testers to have a chance to collaborate with the rest of the product team, instead of being an isolated entity that enters the scene just before the product release. The value addition of the testers has been of great help to the team to realize their potential.

### **Stronger Ties With End Users**

Given that in an Agile program, the product team is more receptive and engaged with end users, testers act as the end-user representatives on the team be it in product demonstrations, beta programs, usability studies, or anything else. This gives the team a better understanding of the product from the end user's perspective.

### **Timely Delivery and Customer Satisfaction: **

Well thought-out Agile development helps in delivering timely business solutions that have been built as per the specific demands of the clients. Agile also provides an environment where the inputs and feedback can be taken at any step, improving the solution at every milestone. Adding to the multifarious forms of testing, you can always have clients that are greatly satisfied with your services.

### **The Quality of Software Applications: **

Agile testing requires breaking apart a larger piece of code into smaller, convenient parts. This helps the developers to focus completely on the smaller parts of the code, which leads to improvements in the overall quality, strength, and testing of the software and/or application. Since Agile encourages phased development cycles, it promotes recurrent builds, which makes it necessary to conduct more tests and evaluations for each iteration. It is a **[faster approach to achieve quality](http://www.seasiainfotech.com/blog/agile-testing-a-faster-approach-to-achieve-quality/)** which also leads to early identification of issues that can be fixed (at much lower costs), thereby improving the quality of the software.

### **Business Value: **

While every organization talks about business value, only a few are able to define what they mean by it. To be measured accurately, business values require defining realistic, attainable, and time-based business objectives that can be allied with the strategies being used. Achieving such goals requires a seamless working environment. The Agile-DevOps combination helps to provide an environment where the existing practices and principles work cohesively to grow business value.

### **Productivity: **

In an Agile process, you need to ensure that the people who are working on a given task are the people best suited for it. Agile promotes an atmosphere where the resultant product is assessed and not the people who made the product. Both the practices, if insured, will definitely help in increasing the overall productivity of the team as a whole, and the organization will hence be able to succeed in its goals.

### **Process Improvement: **

Agile, as a process, is a very team-oriented methodology. A lot of organizations fail because they do not have proper processes in place. Agile processes put a lot of emphasis on creating a team-based culture. Due to this, the quality of the resulting software is the responsibility of the whole team, rather than that of a single individual. Hence, the process must be able to promote communication and shared responsibilities.

## **Final Words**

Lastly, Agile methodologies have forced testers to improve their own field and help everyone to do better and contribute their bit to the product under development. Testing has come a long way.
