# Agile Vs. Lean: Yeah Yeah, What’s the Difference?

Is Agile the same as Lean? When people say "agile" do they really mean Scrum? Or do people still use different types of agile - and if so, why?

Been getting a lot of questions lately, so thought I'd take a stab at this…

## Lean

Lean comes from [Lean Manufacturing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) and is a set of principles for achieving quality, speed & customer alignment (same as what we're trying to do with agile development, right?).

[Mary & Tom Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/people.htm) adapted the principles from Lean Manufacturing to [fit software development](http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381) and I believe these ideas actually provide the premises behind _why_ agile works:

1\. Eliminate Waste
5\. Deliver Fast

2\. Build Quality In
6\. Respect People

3\. Create Knowledge
7\. Optimize the Whole

4\. Defer Commitment

In a nutshell, Lean says to relentlessly eliminate _anything_ that isn't adding value and only work on what we absolutely need to be doing at this moment in time. Eliminating waste means eliminating useless meetings, tasks and documentation. But it _also _means eliminating time spent building what "we know" we'll need in the future (things are constantly changing so we often end up _not_ needing them - or if we do, we have to rework them because conditions and our understanding has changed by then). It also means eliminating inefficient ways of working - like [multitasking](http://agilesoftwaredevelopment.com/blog/jackmilunsky/7-software-development-wastes-lean-series-part-5-motion) (!) - so we can deliver fast.

Lean also puts a very strong emphasis on what it calls "the system" - that is, the way that the team operates _as a whole_. We always need to be looking at our work from a top level to ensure we're optimizing for the whole. For example, many managers want to "optimize" individual developers by ensuring they're always at 100% - but most of the time, this is actually _counter-productive_. Let's not have people coding something that isn't needed (or fully defined yet) just for the sake of coding, because that actually creates _more work_ for us in the future (see: [Why You Should Let Your Developers Surf](https://hackerchick.com/why-you-should-let-your-developers-surf/)).

Along those lines, Lean says to respect that the people _doing_ the work are the ones that best know _how _to do it. Give them what they need to be effective and then trust them to do it. Software development is about _learning,_ so structure the work to ensure we're continuously learning. And because of that, defer decisions until the last responsible moment (because we'll know more by then). Finally, develop in a way that builds quality _into _our product, because there's no way to continuously deliver fast if we have to keep going back to clean up our messes.

_"Organizations that are truly lean have a strong competitive advantage because they respond very rapidly and in a highly disciplined manner to market demand, rather than try to predict the future."_ - Mary Poppendieck

## Agile

Agile refers to a set of values and principles put forth in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). The Manifesto was a reaction against heavyweight methodologies that were popular, yet crippling software projects from actually doing what they needed to do - create software that helped the customer! I believe Agile's values & principles work_ because _of the science behind Lean and so you'll see a lot of similar themes repeated in agile.

The Agile Manifesto's values are:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
**Responding to change** over following a plan

And it's principles are:

1\. Highest priority is customer satisfaction
7\. Progress measured by working software

2\. Welcome changing requirements
8\. Sustainable development pace

3\. Frequent delivery of software
9\. Continuous attention to technical excellence

4\. Business people & developers cooperating daily
10\. Simplicity

5\. Build projects around motivated people
11\. Self-organizing teams

6\. Face-to-face conversation is best
12\. Regular reflection & adaptation

Any project that follows these values and principles can rightly be considered to be agile. That said, there are definitely preferred practices that are common for agile teams to follow in order to achieve agility. Most commonly:

  * **Scrum **or **Kanban **(or a hybrid of the two) for "Management Practices"
  * **Extreme Programming (XP) **for Technical Practices (with new practices becoming popular, largely from Lean Startup - such as Continuous Deployment and Testing in Production)

A good agile team picks and choses the management & technical practices that best work for them. (a bad one just picks a couple of practices and falsely believes that somehow "makes them agile" - see: [Are We Agile Yet?](https://hackerchick.com/are-we-agile-yet/)).

In [Part II](https://hackerchick.com/kanban-is-the-new-scrum/), I'll post summaries of these agile methods and practices.
