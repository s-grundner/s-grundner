Bill Gates was quoted as saying:

> "The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency."

The DevOps movement over the last few years seems to be strong empirical evidence for that statement -- and the numbers seem to support it, too. An Enterprise Management Associates [research report](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=KUL12366USEN) indicates that companies in which Continuous Delivery frequency increased by 10% or more were 2.5 times more likely to experience double-digit (â‰¥10%) revenue.
