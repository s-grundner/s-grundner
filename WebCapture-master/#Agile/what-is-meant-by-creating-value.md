As consumers, we buy a product based on our judgement of its inherent worth and how well it will fulfill meeting a need or desire. This value is reflected in both the selling price and market demand. For the lean practitioner, delivering this value as purely as possible is the pursuit at hand.

There are numerous processes performed and actions taken by a producer to deliver value to the customer. Typically, only a very small percentage actually create value. The large majority consume resources without creating value for the customer. These activities are considered waste and simply add cost and delays. Ruthlessly sorting out the value creating steps from the wasteful, or non value creating, steps and then aggressively eliminating the wasteful steps is potentially the greatest source of improvement for an organization in terms of performance and competitiveness.

The acid test as to whether a task is value creating is to ask if the customer would judge a product less valuable if the task could be left out without affecting the product. For example, rework would unlikely be judged of any value by the customer, while actual fabrication steps, right the first time, would be.

Upon sorting value creating steps from wasteful steps, not only can the wasteful steps begin to be eliminated, the value creating steps can be further improved to assure they are indeed valuable, capable, available, flexible, and adequate.
