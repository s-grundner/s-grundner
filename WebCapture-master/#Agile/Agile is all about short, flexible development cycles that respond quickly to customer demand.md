Agile is all about short, flexible development cycles that respond quickly to customer demand. Since you are, in effect, building a continuous, two-way software pipeline between you and your customers, you should have the idea of continuous delivery in mind from the start.  Continuous Delivery is a software development strategy that optimizes your delivery process to get high-quality software into the hands of your customers as quickly as possible. The notion of releasing a prototype, or minimum viable product (MVP), is crucial for getting early feedback. Once the MVP is released, you're then able to get feedback by tracking usage patterns, which is a way to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources right away. Every release going forward can then be measured for how well it converts into the user behaviors you want the release to achieve. The concept of a  baseline MVP product that contains just enough features to solve a specific business problem will also reduce wasted engineering hours and a tendency for feature creep or 'gold plating' among large, distributed software teams.
