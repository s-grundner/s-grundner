Without a doubt love takes a lot of work, but for most people it is, whether they admit it or not, one of the most important things in life. From love of one's family members, to love between two partners, material items in life pale in comparison to a close relationship with someone you love.

There are many sacrifices that come with devoting your life to another person, and nobody agrees on everything, but when you try to live without anybody, what matters the most to you? What do you do everyday that makes work and everything else you have to do worth it?

A while back several illustrations depicting the ups and downs of modern day relationships went viral, and they went viral because as cringey as this 2018-style modern format of "25 illustrations that say this" may be to some people, it strikes a certain nerve.

These illustrations were made by Amanda Oleander, a Los Angeles-based artist who understands relationships because she is in a committed relationship herself, said to be utterly infatuated with the different ways people act in the open and behind closed doors.

She thinks of ways to depict the different activities and routines of people in relationships, and then puts it to the canvas: or nowadays, the photoshop, or whatever she used to produce the illustrations.

Here are 25+ illustrations by Amanda Oleander.

Oleander is currently with a partner named Joey Rudman, and she said _"[He] ends up drawn in most of my drawings. We have been together for almost 3 years. He's the sweetest man I've ever met."_

"Magic" is the best way she can describe the bond she shares with her partner.

_"Before I met Joey if anyone told me their love and relationship was like ours I wouldn't believe it. It's nothing less than amazing. We can't get enough of each other. I'm enthralled by the way people behave behind closed doors, intimate moments we never get to see. Those are moments that can't really be documented because if they were, it would alter the way the person behaved. So I draw them," _she said.

A different concept inspires each of her drawings._ "I do wish that viewers take with them a sense of confidence and appreciation for the simple moments in life,"_ she continued.

Without a doubt, people are being surrounded by negativity here in 2018. Therefore any little thing like this that can inspire a little positivity, even if it's a little dumb, is something that should be appreciated.
