Or why agencies better get good at service design. Fast.

Sony strikes a [deal](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/17/11256504/soundcloud-sony-music-licensing-deal) with Soundcloud, and Jay Z removes the best albums he has ever made from the most popular streaming services ([except for the one he owns](http://pitchfork.com/news/64166-jay-zs-blueprint-albums-vanish-from-spotify-itunes-amazon/)).

> _Album as a service_

[Kanye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West) releases an update to his latest album, [The Life of Pablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo).

[Tidal](http://tidal.com/gb) subscribers get a new version of Wolves and the Frank Ocean "track" is a whole new "file" … Frank's Track.

> "This is in fact the second "update" to the album since its launch; and it's just dawned on me that he's treating it a bit like _software_. When your music is stored on a server to be streamed of course you can patch it and update it like a developer would do an app, a plug-in or a blogger might edit a post. You can react to feedback from your audience like a new kind of asynchronous performance. It figures that you could even [A/B ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)or [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics) test different versions to hone it. "

Ben Bashford gets back to [blogging](https://medium.com/@bashford/music-as-software-712be54394d8#.qvszkaoh9) with a thought around music as a service.

[Henry](https://medium.com/@prehensile/this-is-making-me-think-a-lot-of-stuff-31b153c4db35#.tcxw97kdv) adds some fuel to Ben's post with …

> Album-as-a-service. Buying it isn't like buying a thing at all, it's more like subscribing to this particular pocket of Kanye-space.

He also references the work around totems, IoT, and products as the sharp point of a service. The pointy bit that pops through the membrane of the network.

> That thing we were all talking about with IoT, where the product isn't what you're buying, it's the business model and infrastructure provided by a given company with any given product just the pointy end of a much larger system. A touchpoint. Kanye's touchpoint. … It's just like fiat currency, that idea that paper cash has no value in itself, it's a reference to some value elsewhere. Fiat culture. Promise to play the bearer one Kanye album.

Trapped in a hotel in Vancouver, Canada, I am sat watching basketball and thinking about work. Last Wednesday a bunch of new things from Nike [emerged into the world](http://www.freshnessmag.com/2016/03/17/new-nike-plus-app-june-2016/), some of which I had been fortunate to have worked on for last couple of years. In themselves they are probably not world denting, but what they have enabled for Nike, is as much about business transformation as it is consumer wins. The app is a sharp point to a service. A service that involves physical stores, run clubs, events, knitted products that are created as consumers design them, content strategies based on physical activities, non linear story telling and breaking org charts into atoms and networks.

Meanwhile somewhere in London, Daniel Hall, from Sony Music talks to the drum about their new deal with Soundcloud

> "We're the canary in the mine in terms of digital disruption and our business model is permanently evolving," … "Now we're moving from a product model to one that's increasingly about access rather than permission. Streaming is becoming the biggest part of the audience and if you project over the next couple of years, it's going to become an important platform."

Dan Hauck, head of strategy at Redscout who is working with Sony said

> "It's a way of joining up all the different marketing parts because at the moment people are pushed along this journey but at the end there is no purchase, …we just want them to listen as much as we can get them to because that's how [record labels] now need to make money."

Hold on! Some of these words sounded wrong to me -- "pushing people" "journey" and purchase being the final point ?

> "At the moment it's about getting the **concept** right and thinking about how the consumer engages with our artists and our content in a more relevant way, …The opportunity for us moving forward is how we can anticipate the way people are going to behave"

And after reading this final quote from Daniel, it came to me…

I wonder how many Keynote decks he has seen, all of them hoping to solve SONY's revenue problems. I wonder how many decks started with a problem statement that was rooted solely in their business with no regard for people who just love to listen to music. I wonder how many "concepts" he had seen that all felt like they would fall quicker into the uncanny value than a QR code. Perhaps he even prototyped these concepts, probably in Liverpool St Station or a bar in Shoreditch.

If anyone is going to help David, Sony and all the other companies wrestling with our new connected world they had all better be amazing at Service Design.

Remember -- Service Design **is** Design. Not photoshop design, or Cad design, or Keynote magic move design or even Flinto design. It is **designing for service**.

It is designing the white spaces, the gaps between the things, the connections, the handovers, the handoffs, expecting that most people are messy, will have their hands full, will not be thinking about your shoes right now, they will be wondering if they will make the train, if their children will be OK, if they will sleep properly tonight, if their love is real.

Service design is not a just coming up with a "concept" in a deck and then wrapping it in statements that say "service first".

Service design is not just another word for UX to help get a raise from your boss.

Service design is not something that covers up the cracks in modern advertising, or marketing like a plaster/band aid.

Service design involves you designing, not concepting.

If your agency/consultancy/company is helping others work out to help people operate in this connected networked world, you better hope you have some good service designers or designers that can design services.

Because we are all going to need them. A lot of them.
