Have you ever listened to a song and felt like it was written just for you? A song where every word, every string and drum beat made you feel like somehow the artist took a peak into your mind and was able to compose a track you would immediately connect with? Well that's essentially the aim of all User Experience Designers.

User Experience (UX) Designers aim to make you feel like any service or product you (the user) interact with is designed with your needs and desires in mind. And like many musicians, some have created some of the most iconic hits of all time, and wellâ€¦some fail. Nevertheless _the intention_ is always there.

So you may ask, how do User Experience Designers do what they do? How do they balance pleasing users while at the same time meeting business goals and the stakeholders who hired them in the first place?

Let's take a step back into my song analogy. Here's where a lot of entrepreneurs/stakeholders, like musicians are similar. Most start by creating a product (or song) that stems from a vision or passion. Then they work toward producing this vision and last, they'll release it into the world and _hope _it's somethingyou'll experience and love.

User Experience Designers aim to do the same thing; create something you'll love, but the main difference is that UX Designers start with your hopes and needs _first,_ and then based on your feedback, (ideally) they'll get to share if the vision stakeholders have, still aligns with yours _before_ releasing that product into the world.

To learn more about User Experience, I dove into [books](http://userexperiencestrategy.com/), [online articles](https://www.conversioner.com/blog/beginners-guide-understanding-ux-design), and helpful blogs curated by [Designlab](https://medium.com/u/2c97cc6869c8) realizing that it takes quite a bit of orchestration and many disciplines are involved. Numerous experts in the field go about explaining UX differently, but I've found [Elizabeth Bacon's](http://deviseconsulting.com/defining-ux/) model of Understanding, Defining and Communicating (UDC) a user's needs through various methods pretty comprehensive:

Elizabeth comes from an Interaction Design background and often explains that she breaks down User Experience activities from that lens:

I would argue that most UX Designers today are performing a large combination of these activities, but roles are becoming more specialized such as "UX Researchers" and "UX Architects" as explained by the folks from [UXDesign.CC](http://uxdesign.cc/ux-trends-2015-2016/).

And last, another resource that I enjoy using to learn about User Experience is good ol' twitter. [Jennifer Aldrich](https://medium.com/u/d51f10819a33) often tweets pretty great visuals that express in a simplified way how each discipline in UX can influence a user's overall feelings towards a product or service:

So the next time you hear the term, User Experience, think of it as the overall feeling you get when interacting with a product or service (good or bad) and if designed well, you might feel as lucky as my friend on the right up there, because who doesn't want to love puppies? Right?
