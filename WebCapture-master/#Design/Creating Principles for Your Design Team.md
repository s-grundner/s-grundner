# Creating Principles for Your Design Team

_Captured: 2016-03-23 at 23:01 from [medium.com](https://medium.com/iq-design/creating-principles-for-your-design-team-2e13fb351465)_

Most designers are familiar with [design principles](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?854), or the key characteristics and goals for a product that help designers validate their design decisions. Our design team at SalesforceIQ decided to define not just the design principles that drive our product design decisions but also the principles that drive our behaviors as a team. After several introspective conversations around who we are as a team, we came up with our initial set of Design Team Principles.

What are these principles, exactly?

> Design team principles are tenets that guide us toward how we want to operate as a design team in order to make us happy and successful each day at work.

They are used to keep each other honest as we work together and work with the broader team. They also set expectations for how we want others to perceive us and how our actions influence those perceptions.

These principles aren't just words to throw up on a wall or something we created once and subsequently forgot about. These principles are core to how we operate as designers at SalesforceIQ. They help us evolve and improve by understanding:

  * What are we doing now that embodies these principles?
  * What are we doing that might be counter to these principles?
  * What should we change in order to live up to these principles?

It's worth noting that none of these principles are entirely exclusive to us as a design team, and one could argue these are principles everyone should live up to. However, they have helped us personally focus on our behaviors and identify personal development areas to help us better engender these principles.

Below are the principles that we have defined for our team.

#### **Our Attitude: We are…**

  * **Passionate **and driven about our craft
  * **Positive** in our attitude toward the challenges that we may face
  * **Supportive** of all team members, always being inclusive and respectful of others
  * **Weird** in the way we embrace strange ideas and our own quirkiness so that we cultivate creativity
  * **Witty, **silly, and fun so that we encourage thinking differently and enjoy our everyday work life
  * **Frickin' Friendly** to everyone and anyone, staying kind and caring in our actions
  * **Humble** about our skills and always willing to continually learn and improve
  * **Egalitarian **in how we perceive our team members and our respective contributions to the team

#### **Working With Others: We are…**

  * **Collaborative **allies when working through ideas and coming up with solutions
  * **Open **and receptiveto feedback, criticism, educating others, and evolving our processes
  * **Flexible** in how we operate and address constraints
  * **Approachable **and accessible to others' needs whenever possible
  * **Reliable **and trustworthy team members
  * **Authentic **in our attitude and approach, staying honest to ourselves and others
  * **Transparent **in how we make decisions and consider tradeoffs

#### **Our Approach: We are…**

  * **Creative **when thinking through ideas, always exploring concepts and being adventurous
  * **Thoughtful **in how we approach our design work and how we interact with each other
  * **Scientific **and informed by data in our processes and how we make design decisions
  * **Active** in keeping up to date with best practices and participating within the design community
  * **Strategic **in how we approach problems, staying proactive instead of reactive
  * **Advocates **for the user and our design process
  * **Practical** in our solutions, always considering the implications of our solutions

In creating similar principles for your team, think about what is important to you and how you want the team to contribute to the broader company. These principles should be revisited frequently and owned by the entire team. And lastly, the principles should help you identify tactical ways to make your team happier and more successful. Use them to find opportunities to make the team operate more effectively, and you'll be pleasantly surprised with the results.
