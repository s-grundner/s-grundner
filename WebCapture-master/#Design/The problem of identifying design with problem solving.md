Many designers of all disciplines, some of them renowned names, keep in their speech the statement **"design is problem solving"** with the good intention of giving design a supposedly lost image of functionality and rigor.

I understand the use of "… is problem solving" as a metaphor, as an attempt to distance design from the ornamental and whimsical. I can also understand it as an attempt to elucidate what we can contribute to a project, not only to decorate the cake, but also dedicating our efforts to noble causes. Such important matters as "problem solving". It´s like the old "improve on people´s lives" brought back down to earth.  
This simplification might be useful in some situations, as the definition of problem can be roughly applied to almost anything. But, as it never seemed precise to me, I cannot resist thinking about this issue.

This expression is repeated as a slogan here and there, but almost never what is being called problem and solution are detailed. At best, the term is accompanied by an explanation of its intended meaning: design detached from art, fully functional, everything has a purpose, … That's fine, it's just explaining what design is, but there is a mismatch between expression and explanation.

If a client or stakeholder is as inexperienced as not to understand that design is not the same as styling, delivering him "it´s problem-solving" without further explanation may only increase confusion.

It seems that this speech implies an inferiority complex, a mediocre _solution _to an alleged _problem _as old and tiresome as the design itself: to be understood as stylists.

#### Run away from styling

Some designers, maybe as a reaction, seem to want to transcend the aesthetic design aspect avoiding bringing it to the table. Even when they perform beautiful works. To speak about beauty has become uncomfortable. It could become a time-consuming argument and deflect attention from "core design tasks".  
Yes, sometimes I avoided this issue when dealing with a customer.

Others place at a higher level those design works focused purely on function, efficiency and measurable results. White background and blue links on digital products, flat aluminium sheet and visible screws in physical products. A seasoned designer knows that sometimes it doesn´t make sense to spend resources in a delightful look and feel. And would deliver valuable products with a naked design approach, very appropriate in some cases. In some cases.  
Yes, sometimes I've felt very proud of having satisfied a client with this kind of design.

Maybe we are taking to the extreme the idea that _"beauty is the result of right"_, a Japanese proverb quoted by Bruno Munari in "How do objects are born". It could be interpreted that when everything makes sense and works, automatically is beautiful.

But obviously, to solve problems and achieve beauty are not incompatible activities, so, why "problem solving" is not the best way to explain our work?

First, we should know what we are calling a **problem**: a perceived gap between what we have and what we want, a situation we want to change.

#### Common "local" problems

Working on the design of a product, rather than the client's briefing, what I usually consider "problems" are issues or barriers to overcome in order that the product reaches the goal. It´s the mentioned distance between the state we have and the state we want, where the state we want is the design brought to reality and working perfectly. They could be named as local problems in contrast to the global problem from the briefing.

They are something to be overcome, but not enough to complete a great job, they are at the base of the pyramid. I'm talking about a no obvious joint between parts, a shape which increases manufacturing cost, slow queries to a database, too much information on one screen, a brand without enough contrasts on a particular background.

They are well-defined problems, if we find one solution, it can be sufficient. You can use a process of analysis and subsequent synthesis.

The approach of dealing with such problems is engineerish, assuming that the problem can be well defined, decomposed to address each cause and a solution that can be true or false can be built.

With this point of view I don't want to undervalue or detach engineering and design, quite the contrary, but just highlight differences of both approaches and how they complement each other.

_Engineering vs. design (Design paradigms. Peter Ljungstrand)_

**_Engineering approach_**

  * _Define problem_
  * _Look for best solution_
  * _Assumes problem can be well-define_
  * _Divide-and-conquer_
  * _Based on analytical and mathematical skills_
  * _Solution is true or false_

**_Design approach_**

  * _Wicked problems_
  * _Try to understand the situation_
  * _Explore possibilities to better understand the problem_
  * _Iterative work_
  * _Sketching_
  * _Solution is good or bad, better or worse_

In many cases, this kind of problems are based on a contradiction and accept an algorithmic and heuristic solving strategy (principles, rules and strategies).

A well known method in engineering, [TRIZ](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ), is based on solving technical contradictions (partially or completely). TRIZ is the Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, developed by the inventor, engineer, scientist and writer Genrich Altschuller. Of course, he was deported to Siberia. Altschuller studied over 400,000 patents and concluded that most of them are based on 40 principles of invention. He developed a methodology to "replicate the creative process of inventors".

I´ve tried to apply this method sometimes designing physical products, when stucked with a technical problem. The first issue was to clearly define the contradiction, which isn´t usually easy. The second issue was to isolate the contradiction, to avoid that if a characteristic is modified, others would get worse.

The next step after trying to do something systematic (as TRIZ) is to automate it. In 1959 [Herbert A. Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon), [J. C. Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Shaw) and [Allen Newell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell) created a software called General Problem Solver (GPS) with the aim of achieving a universal system to solve problems. Not bad.

#### Specificities of design problems

To ask a designer to solve a problem we should set it: "This is the problem to be solved". It is still common to set fixed requirements to get a specific goal, but freezing conditions does not freeze the problem in which they are based. The requirements are only a model (among numerous) of the problem.

In design is usual to run into non-completely defined problems, even not articulated yet. A product that creates frustration when used, makes visible a problem, it may or may not be well defined, but sometimes what the designer has to look for are opportunities from still unexpressed needs. Indeed, these cases are those where a designer puts really into play her skills.

It could be said that to reveal problems is characteristic of design, redefine problems and work with so-called [wicked problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) (those difficult or impossible to solve since they present incomplete, contradictory and/or changing requirements that are generally difficult to recognize).

It's a field where the problem is defined as it's solved ([idea of coevolution of problem and solution](http://oro.open.ac.uk/3278/1/Creativity_-_coevolution.pdf)).

Often it's not easy to represent the differences between the current state and future desired state. The desired state may not have been specified yet or in a incomplete or provisional way. It's also possible to have trouble comparing these states because of differences in the form and level of representation between what we have and what we want. We cannot presuppose that there is something like a set "design problem" at any point in the design process. (Kees Dorst, 2006, [Design Problems and Design Paradoxes](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mitpressjournals.org%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1162%2Fdesi.2006.22.3.4&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFI4xPFvXnhTLwS7Bm1sIeAhTEftQ))

Solutions generated along the process are not unique and do not imply the problem ends. They're good or bad, better or worse, not true or false. The end is rather a point of sufficiently satisfactory balance.

Simon and Papanek considered design mainly a problem-solving activity, even so:

> "Design is a Satisficing Activity. Making decisions without complete information by accepting good enough solutions rather than optimising and calculating the optimum one, is a distinctive characteristic of design." ([Herbert A. Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon), The Sciences of the Artificial)

> "Because design as a problem-solving activity can never, by definition, yield one right answer: it will always produce an infinite number of answers, some "righter" and some "wronger." The "rightness" of any design solution will depend on the meaning and which we invest the arrangement." [Victor Papanek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek)

#### How a designer solves problems

In The Sciences of the Artificial, Herbert A. Simon lays out design as a problem solving activity, but in which much of the effort is devoted to structure these problems and only a part to solve them.

This is a traditional conception of systematic problem decomposition, where design is considered nothing special compared to other problem-solving activities. (Willemien Visser, 2007, [Designing as Construction of Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1227)) Thus, there is an analysis stage first, followed by a synthesis stage in which the solution is built. The problem is considered as something given to the designer.

However, empirical studies have shown that designers don´t decompose the problem systematically and that the same problem can be decomposed in different ways depending on the designer's experience. (Willemien Visser, 2007, [Designing as Construction of Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1227)) Moreover, the effort to structure the problem takes place throughout the design process, not just at the beginning. Problem and solution evolve simultaneously, the design problem is solved to understand it.

It seems that the characteristic way a designer solves problems is not much like what is commonly understood as problem solving.

What problem does a designer solve when working on a wristwatch, a chair or new car model?

It seems that there are many solutions to the core problems (to know what time it is, sitting, mobility). Perhaps the problem is how to find a place in a competitive market, be desirable for the consumer, differentiating, return the prestige to a brand … in any case, problems for the client of design services, not for users.

Design involves problem solving, in the same way that implies its "construction" or redefinition from the partial information available.

[As Armand Hatchuel argued](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-K_theory), design includes problem solving, but it cannot be reduced to problem solving. To reduce design to problem solving is bound to miss important aspects of the design activity.

Designing is rather to find a balance between all constraints and information generated during the design process.
