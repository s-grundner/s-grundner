Google Primer: Anyone looking to learn more about marketing -- from startup founders to small business owners to brand managers at Fortune 500 companies.

Colour could be the single most important aspect of your app other then functionality. It not only gives Uses a sense of place but also forms a key part of how the app feels, providing the platform for the User Experience. It can define your app in a crowded market.

This is having a huge influence on future app design.

**Bold, graphic, intentional**

The foundational elements of print-based design -- typography, grids, space, scale, color, and use of imagery -- guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic interface that immerse the user in the experience.

There has been a surge lately in using colour in app design, with Material Design and Flat Design trends helping to promote this approach.

The hipster trend of going completely zen and using black-and-white has also ran it's course. Every app starts looking the same. People also want the emotion that colour brings but in a simple, clear way.

The new [Google Marketing App Primer ](https://www.yourprimer.com)uses colour so prominently that it really stands out not only in the App but in the on-boarding stage. You can see how important they value this on-boarding page by the level of detail they go to in getting the colours and composition just right.

One of the most popular App in Brazil now is a quiz game to help students pass their college exam [G1 Enem App](http://especiais.g1.globo.com/educacao/app-g1-enem/). This App goes maybe a step further then Google Primer in that is narrows in on colour to not only help identify the app -amongst a growing list of games in this area- but also aims to simplfy.

By limiting the App to one main colour range, in this case Red, you automaticlly give your users a strong sense of place. This enhances the user experience.

In this screen to the left users view their progress amongst 4 main areas of expertise. Overlaying simple graphs is simple on a colour range like this.

Extending the main choice of colour to main categories helps further define each area of the App. Icons can be large and purposeful, like performance gauges and badges. It also forces you to design in a simple clear way.

It's important to match the brand of your app to the kind of app you're creating. For the quiz app the red colours are appropriate because it's about speed, knowledge, and passion for the subject. The red promotes a sense of movement and action. With a countdown timer for each question it's not a place for contemplation.

> Red also can mean stop of a warning signal so it's important to match the colour to the context of your app.

Designing for colour helps you lead with a design that places emphasis on shapes and bold forms. This makes your job as a designer so much easier as you're not wasting time crafting amazing icons or design elements. Not that there's anythign wrong with that but for apps which are task based it makes sense to keep the design simple and straightforward.

Historically Google did not place much importance to colour within apps or services. It was always a white background with minimal colour tints on icons. Now with Material design there is a huge turnaround.

Material design will do more for colour then the last major design era of the 60's and 70's. Our screens are now such a dominant area of our lives. With the push and ease of implementation of Material Design there will be a huge transformation of colour on our screens to help define these new digital places.

Google now has a [dedicated space for colour in Material Design](http://www.google.com.br/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette) and have published colour swatches for Illustrator and Photoshop.

#### Study the meaning behind colours, each colour can have both a positive and negative connotation so you need to know what these are and match them to your app

#### Using colour can be dangerous, go too strong and it can come off looking childish or garish, too weak and it can look pale and washed out. It's might seem easier to just go black-and-white, grayscale or monotone but spend the time, don't flake out, as seen in [Google Primer](https://www.yourprimer.com) and [G1 Enem](http://especiais.g1.globo.com/educacao/app-g1-enem/index.html), it can really have a huge impact.

## Enjoy experimenting with colour.
