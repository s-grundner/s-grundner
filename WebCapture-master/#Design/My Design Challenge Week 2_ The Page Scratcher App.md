Week 2 is done out of 12 (read the original [article](https://medium.com/@ryan_d_lysaght/my-design-challenge-week-1-the-honeydo-app-5aaf49e3e2b1)). I feel complete in a 16% sort of way. That's 2 divided by 12 if you didn't get the joke.

This week I present you with the PageScratcher app. That's right, I'm taking on the e-book industry. Move over Amazon Kindle, Ryan's going to perform a death-defying cannonball and make a splash in your proverbial market. Of course, I'm being sarcastic. And I didn't make a product to compete against the monster that is Kindle. That _would_ be death-defying. And I would never do that.

Scroll down to the bottom to see the mockups if you don't want to hear how I made it.

### What Is PageScratcher?

In short, it's a subscription-based service for books. As I say that, there may be red flags jumping up and down in your head saying, "You do realize there are some serious competitors doing this sort of thing already, right?" Yep. I'm completely aware of Kindle Unlimited, Scribd, and Oyster. I'm also completely aware of how dissatisfied I am with all of those services. That's why I'm making this app.

For those of you who are voracious readers and eat books like their your mama's cookin', you may have tried any of the services I mentioned above. In a cliche way, reviewers have named these services the "Netflix of books." As this attribution suggests, these e-book products provide customers with unlimited books for a monthly subscription. And, if any of you are aware of how publishing companies currently operate (like Pearson or HarperCollins), you'll be very suspicious of that word "Unlimited." Because, when they say "Unlimited," they really mean limited…and probably not the books you want…nor will they be new…nor will they be on any bestseller list. Now if you look into any of these services, they will boast a huge library. Kindle Unlimited says they have over 1 million books available with the service. That _is_ an impressive number. It's also impressive how they can provide so many books that I don't want to read. This has been a huge detractor for many [reviewers](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/why-i-cancelled-my-kindle-unlimited-subscription) of the service: even though there are a lot of books in their libraries, the really popular one's aren't there to read.

It does make sense, however, that these services would be limited. Publishers and authors want to make money after all. Publishing companies would never allow their work (bestselling or new) to surface on a subscription-based library. As an example, when was the last time you saw a new movie on Netflix's streaming subscription? Unless it was an original Netflix movie, the answer is never. On average, Kindle Unlimited books cost less than $4 to purchase on their own. I'm no supply and demand expert, but if you're selling a book for $4, it's because you also think its worth is $4.

There is one more flaw with subscription-based services for e-books. The general public does not read nearly as much as they watch movies, videos, or TV. I think that's pretty obvious. So, the business model cannot be the same as Netflix. If anyone might have noticed, Netflix's library is pretty limited as well; but, in the minds of millions of people, Netflix provides great value. So what's the difference? The average American reads maybe 300 words per minute. That means its going to take them 8 hours to finish a decent sized novel (or if you decide to read the Game of Thrones series, it'll take you forever). I can watch 4-5 movies within that 8 hour time frame. So, what's the point of an unlimited library if I'll only read one or two books a month?

### How is Page Scratcher Different?

In comparison to Kindle Unlimited, PageScratcher also has a subscription based service but with a twist. As mentioned above, Kindle costs $10 a month for their 1 million book library and access to a whole lot of books that you don't want. PageScratcher will also give you a whole bunch of books along with the subscription but a significant discount on newer books than you could find anywhere else. So, here is value proposition: the benefit of the subscription is not just a large library of free books, but also a club-like membership to significantly discounted newer/premium titles. Although the point of this challenge is not necessarily to work out an entire business model, the subscription would have to be more than Kindle Unlimited per month, but you would get new books for a lot less. This attempts to solve the problem that subscription services don't provide a benefit for newer books. Obviously, the pricing of this would need significantly more research if someone was to actually go forward with this product (looking into the market, how much do publishers charge for distribution of their books, do we need to limit how many new books someone can buy per month to make a profit, what is our 5 year growth plan, etc.).

One of the other significant differences from Kindle Unlimited is that Page Scratcher is much more social. Imagine GoodReads mixed with Kindle. There is a reason to be on this app because you're discussing and sharing the books you care about as you read them. One of the weakest features of GoodReads is that you always have to manually update your reading status. You finished a book? GoodReads doesn't know (and neither do your friends) until you tell it manually. Obviously, if you're reading a book on Page Scratcher, the app will collect that data and automatically display where you are in a book (if you allow that in your privacy settings).

### If I was going to build PageScratcher

As I said with the last app I built, there are a lot of go-to-market issues with this product. I need to build relationships with publishers and figure out a business model that is conducive to the value proposition I mentioned above. And unlike Page Scratcher, Amazon was in a perfect position to create Kindle Unlimited. They already had an extensive e-book platform and a lot of money to collect that 1 million book library. Even though that library might have a bunch of books I don't want to read, I'm sure that publishers are not giving away those books for free. So, how much overhead is it going to take to accumulate a significant library for people to buy a subscription in the first place? That's something I would need to figure out before I got started.

Also, I would have to probably figure out how people would read books on my app. Haha, really? (Insert sarcasm here) I remember watching an interview with a Kindle programmer a couple of years ago, and their team took a significant amount of time to figure out how to dynamically "justify" text (as in the alignment on a page) responsively across thousands of devices. I'm no programmer, and I would need someone to help me figure out whether this is an issue. Or am I going to have to pay some third party to develop this for me?

Finally, I would be worried about how fast I could get this to market. Let's say that people actually think my twist on the subscription-based service is a good idea. What's to stop them from implementing it? All I'm doing is changing the price of the subscription and making it social. Why couldn't Amazon do that? This sort of reminds me of a company called Breeze that leases new cars to people who want to drive for Uber or Lyft. Both of these companies -- Uber/Lyft -- require drivers to own relatively new cars. So, Breeze helps those who don't have new cars. Great idea! But what if Uber starts leasing new cars? Out of convenience, I would never go to Breeze to lease a car again because my employer (Uber) already gives me one. I don't really want to deal with two different companies when I could receive my paycheck and leasing bill from the same company. Or just to make it easier, Uber could take my leasing bill out of my paycheck. Done. No more Breeze. In the same way, Kindle already has 80%-90% of the features that I am proposing plus millions of users. What happens if they employ my strategy once Page Scratcher is off the ground (assuming my strategy is actually profitable)? I would need to figure out whether or not my product has enough segmentation to withstand the beast that is Amazon.

As a side note, Oyster (one of the major companies I mentioned above) is going out of business. They have not mentioned yet why they are shutting down; but it's not hard to envision why when they're doing similar things to Amazon.

### The Process and Design

So, first things first, I did some research on Kindle users. Here's the thing: almost 40% are Baby Boomers. And around 77% are at least 35 and older. A measly 2% are 18 and younger. And only about 20% of users are in their 20's. So when I made user profiles, I was thinking about you oldies out there. In fact, when I made the logo, I was actually trying to envision what a librarian would look like in 1970. Finally, the color came out of a realization that 60% of Kindle users identify as female. Hence the loud purple and those sassy glasses.

After this I made my basic use cases. The main ones were:

  1. User can access books that are free with the subscription
  2. User can access books that are premium or up for purchase
  3. User can select and access recommended selections
  4. User can select featured, popular, or most highly rated books
  5. User can search for friends and share books with them
  6. User can see what friends are reading
  7. User can search for books
  8. User can give reviews and rate books
  9. User can see description of any book with price, rating, publication details, reviews, and recommendations

So, the navigation of this app is split into two sections: Premium books (the books you buy at a discount) and free books. This is one of the biggest flaws of Kindle Unlimited, it is extremely difficult to find books that are free with your subscription. There is a long list of books on the Kindle Unlimited website that is arduous to read. And the search does not delineate the two. So we are going to fix that deficiency by building it into the navigation. Want to look for new books? You can either search for it, or just navigate to the premium section. Done. The whole app is built for subscribers and thus the separation of the two (free and premium) is easy. Amazon can't do this as easily on their own site because their platform is too multifaceted. Try searching on Amazon for a book that you want to read for free with Kindle Unlimited. Not so easy.

Within these two sections is the ability to filter by popularity, rating, and genre. Price would probably be another filter that we would add on later. The other main section of the app is "Your Study." This is where you would see your most recently read titles, recommendations, and any recent activity.

Here are my early wireframes of the app. Avert your eyes if it's too painful.

What's missing from these wireframes is the navigation bar at the bottom of each mockup. I thought originally the user could just swipe. But I realized that it would be easier to recognize the segmentation between free and newer books if there were visual cues. Also, something that is missing from my mockups is the actual reading part of the app. Here's me saying that I just ran out of time. I envision users actually selecting a reading a book much like they would on Netflix. They choose the book, they can see a description with other recommendation, and choose to read it. This functionality is already designed in the mockups below. However, I show a book that you would have to buy first (it being a premium book) before you read. Imagine instead of the "Sample It" button, they would have a "Read It" button.

Thanks for tuning in this week. Will have another next week for your viewing pleasure. Here are the full mockups with user flow. Once again, I skipped the "Log In" section but did provide mockup showing users selecting their favorite books. This would help the app determine what to recommend and generate on the user's profile.
