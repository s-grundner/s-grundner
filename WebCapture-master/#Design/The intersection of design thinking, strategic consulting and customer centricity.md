D[esign thinking](https://www.google.hr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CD0QFjAGahUKEwjA1t64h-rHAhWHOBoKHQfdCqU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2008%2F06%2Fdesign-thinking&usg=AFQjCNHh9ImeReOFMUXXDxcFbJJ_tJMQXg&sig2=jFzrh79Nop3YxWjOdTd5Ag), a set of intuitive principles bound to bring simplicity in an otherwise complex business situation, has been a topic of consultants, marketers, designers and other industry (and academic) leaders and thinkers for quite some time.

Design thinking is often perceived as a tool that leads to disruptions and success, its main premise being better understanding of customers' wants and needs. That's achieved by observing them in their natural surroundings, listening rather than asking (think of traditional focus groups) and testing and iterating multiple solutions.

> Design thinking can be described as a discipline that uses the designer's sensibility and methods to match people's needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity.

Albeit intuitive, design thinking is still somewhat underused approach to simplifying processes, problems, situations, bottlenecks and relationships between involved parties (demand and supply; people and technology). Borrowing the core design modus operandi -- empathy, understanding, contextual imagining and prototyping, design thinking is used to break the customary problem solving paths by emphasizing the human point of view, instead of processes, technology and other operational elements.

Design thinking is sometimes described as a more loose approach to data, where actions and decisions are based on intuition, rather than solely on hard numbers. Design is not merely aesthetics of a product, but a deep path of functionality and user experience implemented into every process of an organization. Design thinking implements creativity and flexibility in the organizational culture itself, bringing new waves of innovation, blue ocean markets and relieving the employees of singular thinking.

**Desing thinking Vs. or With strategic consulting?**

I had the opportunity to participate in a lecture where Alejandro Acuna, a designer and lecturer on the topic of Design Thinking, gave a lecture in a company where I worked at that time. Apart from shedding some light to the world of design, the central topic was design thinking and its applications in everyday business activities.

As he was explaining the concept and real practical cases and examples, one particular question came to my mind -- is this design approach to problem solving complementary or adversarial to existing methods used in companies and by strategic consultants? Does design thinking completely disregard data? Naturally, that led to new sets of questions, such as "If there is no data, how do you know that a problem exist?'', or "If you know there is a problem, how to direct your search for it?'' But, let's explore things a bit further.

Usually, when an analyst is given a task to find and resolve a certain problem within an organization, s/he starts with making sense of past data in order to at least partially predict future outcomes. Now, that's perfectly fine and valid approach, but how much time should that analyst focus on the past, and how much on the future, i.e. the solution?

And that's actually the point where design thinking suggests focusing more time -- invest in creation, imagining the future, defining changes in user behaviors and engaging in non-linear thinking.

The traditional analysis approach is complementary with creative, out-of-the-box design thinking principles. It's not adversarial or mutually exclusive; together they rather shed new light to business situations, which are becoming more and more complex, ensuring new values and opportunities.

#### It's a partnership between spreadsheets and specifications on one side, and diagrams, sketches and prototypes on the other side.

**Customer centricity online and offline**

In an ever more saturated business environment, where regulations, competition, supply, transparency and connectivity are driving the power of customers to greater levels, marketers are bringing the much needed customer centricity to their organizations. It covers a broad area from ensuring positive experience throughout every touchpoint, managing expectations for each product/customer lifecycle, gathering as much customer/user data possible, to tracking performance of market activities.

Putting your customer in the center of your activities means to develop products and services based on their known and unknown (this is tricky) needs and wants. Henry Ford and Steve Jobs already mastered that, now what can be done in your organization to follow their path?

By combining design thinking principles of creativity and simplicity with standard customer centricity philosophy, either in-house or by hiring consultants, try to see and understand the bigger picture, to perceive the future and changes it brings, and what effects will that have on your business and life.

It might seem simple, but in everyday problems that occur, who has the luxury to speed up the pace of innovation and risk even more? Only the winners, I would say.
