There are close to equal areas of color and space on both sides (right and left) to balance each other. The rabbit in the middle even serves as a fulcrum. It might also stand out a little after you've seen it, but overall the elements don't call attention to themselves individually.

I'm not going to try to figure out which elements counterbalance each other, one element at a time, but hopefully you agree that there's an overall balance. If anything, the chaos is weightier on the right, but not to the point of throwing off the balance.

Content-heavy websites such as news and magazine websites exhibit mosaic balance as well. You might recognize the home page of [The Onion](http://theonion.com). In the screenshot, I've removed the background image behind the top of the page.

There's a lot to look at. The layout isn't symmetrical. The columns aren't equal in size. It's hard to identify what counterbalances what. The blocks of content have different amounts of content inside and, consequently, are different sizes. Nothing radiates from a common center.

There's a bit of chaos and randomness in the different-sized blocks, some denser than others. Because the stories on the website change daily, a different chaos will appear each day. Overall, it works.

Perhaps it's a stretch to say that it's a mosaic balance, but again I would argue that it is and that many websites exhibit this sort of chaotic balance, although something tells me that much of the chaos we see online wasn't planned.

### Summary

It's taken a while to get here, but that concludes our series on design principles. I hope you've enjoyed it, learned something new or found the series to be a good review of fundamental design principles.

As you can guess, I think the fundamentals are important. I started this series to show how all of these principles arise out of human perception and gestalt theory. I didn't make them up. The principles are based on how we all perceive and interpret our visual environment.

For example, one reason we notice focal points is because they contrast with the elements around them. They stand out as different. That's important when you need to quickly determine friend from foe. That ability was important for our survival as a species, and so our eyes developed to make the determination quickly.

However, design principles aren't hard and fast rules. They're guidelines. There's no one right way to communicate that two elements are similar or different, for example. You don't need to follow any of these principles, although you should understand them and have a reason for breaking them.

Again, I hope you've enjoyed this series, and I hope even more that something in the series has given you more control over the visual communication in your designs.
