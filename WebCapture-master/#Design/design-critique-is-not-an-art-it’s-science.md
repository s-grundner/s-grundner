# Design Critique is not an art, itâ€™s science.

Two weeks ago, my boss sat the design team down in a darkened room -- He played this video by MadPow on [how to do a proper design critique](http://vimeo.com/65242833). And as you would expect from this sort of thing, it spoke at length about: going into a critique with good intentions, treating everyone's voice as equal, never shooting down an idea before you've given it a tossle inside your mind, and we should do all this with a _positive attitude_.

_Nope. _**Denied.** I respectfully disagree with this notion, and I'm calling it bullshit.

Let's take a imaginary group of people that each one of us might recognize from our workplace -- Bob, Alice, Peter, Lilian, and Fred.

  * Bob is a pedantic gentleman. He would never fully agree with any idea, and would always, absolutely always, point out every minor imperfection.
  * Alice is a dreamer. Her brain is crammed with wild and exciting ideas and she gushes about wonderful things you can do, but often at the expense of losing sight of technical constraints.
  * Peter is the rationalist. Reasonable, and calm, he tends to weight things numerically against each other. To him, data is king.
  * Lilian is the technologist. She'll tell you about all the technical debt you have to surmount but also about all the new technologies you can leverage.
  * Fred is not even part of the design team. He's actually from marketing. He mainly talks about politically correct things -- Fred perpetuates the status quo.

What happens when you take this group of people and apply the principles that the video and much of design management considers best practice?

  * Alice is going to bring up a new wonderful idea to dramatically improve a web page.
  * Bob being pedantic, and obviously considers his opinions coming from good intent, would point out all the flaws of Alice's design. Not only that but he would rally Lilian to point out all the technical debt that makes this an insurmountable task.
  * Fred would jump in and point out all the business requirements he would like to see and usurp the discussion to talk about a design that's only slightly worse for the user but in reality is only a reskin of the existing product.
  * Finally, Peter would make the rational decision that since no one can agree on anything, it's better to focus on some other issue -- like a standardize list of styles to send around the business in hope that it would create agreement in the future.

Good intentions, and a democracy of opinions is patently not the optimal solution to a productive discussion on Design. These concepts are inherited from the world of fine art. It may be valid for an artist to claim that his painting of a hamster represents a deep internal struggle against overwhelming machines of the internet. It may even be great art, if many viewers and critics alike agree with his opinion and feel the same emotions. But in practical design, we should hold ourselves to a different, if not higher standard. In the world of physics, if someone is not a peer-reviewed, acknowledged physicist, his opinions about quantum mechnics should rightfully matter significantly less. And just like the academic world, fruitful discussions should be moderated and guided. Think of how much more productive it would be if we simply moderated who gets to speak and in what order.

  * Fred would speak first about the concerns of the business and introduce his idea that is basically a reskin of the existing product.
  * Bob, again being pedantic, points out all the small faults of Fred's proposal.
  * Lilian speaks next and further repudiates Fred's idea by mentioning the state of the technical debt. However, she does point out this new technology and how if we were to redo certain things, it would solve a lot of problems.
  * Hearing this, Alice builds on Lilian's idea and gushes about the wonderful ways we can do it.
  * Finally Peter would rightfully say that Fred's idea is significantly outvoted and to tentatively test out the new plan and report back when there's test data.

Design is not, and should not be a democratic process. Design of web applications and services is a very narrow and constrainted field where there is real expertise. In fact, whether or not Fred, the marketing guy, should even be allowed his say should be a testable problem. We can objectively observe and conclude based on peer review and analytical data, whether or not designs, that Fred has contributed to, is of lower quality.

Ultimately, I feel that we are doing Design a disservice by keeping it so tightly coupled with the world of Art. Yes it is where we came from, but so did chemistry, anatomy, and physics. Perhaps the things we design and the problems we solve are more transient and diffcult to test, but the tools are becoming better everyday, and we delude ourselves that the best designs we can do, and the best design community we can nourish is the one that is currently pervasive the world.
