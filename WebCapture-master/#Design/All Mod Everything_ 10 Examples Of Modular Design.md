Transforming and growing according to the needs of the user is a key characteristic of modular architecture and design. It's almost like a collaborative process, with the designer creating a system and the consumer implementing it to suit their needs.

Similar to wooden building blocks, the individual units are simple: a square, a rectangle, a tube--a table or chair. In combination the modules become increasingly complex and customizable, changing to fit the situation.

The04 Counter is [Rem Koolhaas' signature piece of his line of furniture](http://www.architizer.com/blog/oma-unveils-funky-new-furniture-line-during-milan-design-week/) for[ Knoll](http://www.knoll.com/). "Beginning as a monolithic stack of three horizontal beams, the user can rotate the top two beams and transform this wall-like unit into a series of shelves and cantilevered benches--a metamorphosis from a spatial partition to a communal gathering place."

Utilizing the idea of a room within a room, the Alcove Sofa Family is designed to adapt to an open work environment by offering a quiet niche. The simple design is similar to the iconic armchairs by Le Corbusier, and provides a comfortable, upholstered job station. The Alcove Sofa Family is a distinct improvement on the typical room within a room, the cubicle.

Each long rectangular piece of this storage system is stacked into a monolithic block. Areas for storage are created by pushing sections of the table, forming a shelf on one side and an alcove on the other. The [PixelTable is a playful](http://www.architizer.com/blog/pixeltable-transforms-furniture-into-highly-adaptable-game/) use of natural materials and minimalist design.

The cubicle is on its way out. The workplace is literally opening up, with companies emphasizing collaboration and communication as a means to innovation. Laptops, cellphones, and cloud systems do not require a large amount of infrastructure. In that spirit, [Joyn](http://architizer.com/products/joyn/), a new line of office furniture by [Vitra](http://architizer.com/brands/vitra/), gives users the ability to change the workspace to fit specific needs. Centered around a communal worktable, pieces can be quickly changed according to the amount of privacy desired, creating a multifaceted and highly functional work station.

Easily interchangeable pieces allow this table to meet the functional needs of the user.

These examples of modular furniture provide a brief overview of different ways designers and architects are thinking about functionality. The world around us is changing quickly, why shouldn't our furniture and houses give us the ability to change as well?
