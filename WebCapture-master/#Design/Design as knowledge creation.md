# Design as knowledge creation

_Captured: 2015-10-05 at 21:43 from [mariolucero.cl](http://mariolucero.cl/agile/design-as-knowledge-creation/)_

**I wrote this article based on the material and videos of Alistair Cockburn @TotherAlistair so every paragraph between italic quotes belong to him**.

With Agustin Villena (@agustinvillena) started a project in a chilean university which is  
very complex due there are many unknown variables related to the project such as:

  * What will happen if the budget is not enough to finish the project?
  * Do you have each necessary profile in the project?
  * Can everyone work full time at the project?

Because of that Agustin introduced the use of "Design as knowledge creation", it means that we have to discover as soon as possible every possible risk to the project or as he called "architectural variables".  
_**"**In any team design activity, we are working with a problem we don't yet understand, creating_  
_ a solution we don't yet understand, and expressing our ideas in languages and technologies we_  
_ generally don't yet understand - and all of them keep changing out from under us._  
_ As we work, we learn more about the problem, about the technologies, about the proposed solution â€¦_  
_ and eventually, usually just after we've shipped the system, we wake up and go, "Oh! That's how it works",_ _or "Oh! That's how we should have done it".**"**_

### Late knowledge creation in big-bang integration

_**"**In the early stages, everyone is designing away, making decisions, even writing code. But since the code_ _of the various teams haven't been tested against each other, they contain lots of errors.**"**_  
To conclude, we have to be very cautious about the risks or architectural variables at the beginning of the project.  
Obviously, everyone knows that find an error at the end of the project is more expensive to  
fix than earlier but unfortunately with Waterfall is almost impossible to find an error earlier because  
there is any release to the customers until the end of the project.

### Early integration delivers knowledge early

_**"**Teams that integrate early and often take that big surprise and split it over many sessions._  
_ By doing this, they discover their mistakes earlier, that is they "learn" what those mistake were,_  
_ and make it so that later integrations are less likely to fail badly, i.e., the "learning" factor_  
_ becomes smaller over time. This is a good thing._

_Notice in this curve that the learning outstrips the spending early on, which is also a good thing."_

_**"**Finally, notice that once the system risks are put to rest, the actual sequence of development becomes_  
_ nearly irrelevant in terms of "learning". That is, the team can develop in any order, including, particularly,_ _"highest business value first."**"**_

What the curve can't show is just what constitutes "learning items" a.k.a. "risk reduction items."

Rather than asking people on the project what are the "risk items", ask instead, "What worries you?" or  
"What scares you?" The answer is likely to be some piece of technical work that they are unsure of - i.e.,  
needs learning about.  
Once they have learned that, then they are less worried or scared.
