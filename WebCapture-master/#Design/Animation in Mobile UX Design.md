Well-designed animations make the experience feel crafted. In a _human-centered design_ approach, where the user is the prime focus, animation actually creates a feeling of well-being once it's discovered by users.

As a designer, recognizing the invisibility of animations is just as important as designing them. Because you have to create something that feels _human _and accomplishes a task.

#### Benefits of Animation

Animation in mobile apps has a clear, logical purpose. It reduces cognitive load, prevents change blindness and establish a better recall in spatial relationships. But there is one more thing. _Animation brings user interface to life_.

Ideally, in-app animation should:

  * _Provide clear feedback_ in response to user's actions.
  * _Provide system _status to the user.
  * _Guide _and _teach _the user how to interact with the interface.

### Visual Feedback

Visual feedback is extremely important in user interface design. In real life, buttons and controls respond to our interaction, this is how we expect things to work. And responsive interaction encourages deeper exploration of an app by creating logical reactions to user input. Upon an input event, the system should provide instant visual confirmation.

#### Buttons and Controls

User interface elements like buttons and controls should appear _tangible_, even though they are behind a layer of glass. To bridge that gap, visual and motion cues acknowledge input immediately and animate in ways that look and feel like _direct manipulation_.

#### Takeaways

  * Visual feedback works because it appeal to the user's natural desire for _acknowledgement_. It feels great to click through the app and always feel like you know what's happening.
  * Add _clarity _to user input through visual reactions to user input. Make the visual reaction on the user's input _radial_.

### System Status

The user wants to be in control, and trust that the app behaves as expected. It could be even said that users don't like surprises. Animation provides real-time notification of app's process status, enabling the user to quickly understand what is going on.

A well-known animation for this group is "pull down to refresh," which initiates a process of content updates on mobile devices.

Also animation is very helpful during onboarding. User onboarding demands a _flawless UX_, and smooth transitions and good animations in the onboarding flow has a tremendous impact on how first-time users will engage with the app.

#### Takeaway

Provide real-time monitoring of system status. Make it possible for user to quickly understand the current status and answer the question "Where am I?" within the app.

### Meaningful Transitions

You should use animation to smoothly _transport users between navigational contexts_, _explain changes_ in the arrangement of elements on a screen, and _reinforce element hierarchy_. Motion design can effectively guide the user's attention in ways that both inform and delight.

#### **Connect Transitions Visually**

You should create _visual connections_ between transition states through color and persistent elements. Transitioning between two visual states should be clear, smooth, and effortless.

#### Hierarchical Timing

Animation supports the information hierarchy, conveying what content is most important by creating a _path for the eye to follow_.

_Avoid disjointed transactions_ like in the example below.

The timing of transition elements should flow _smoothly _like in example below.

#### Consistent Animation

Transitioning objects should behave in a _coordinated_ manner.

Avoid _haphazard motion_ like in the example below, because it's very _distracting_.

#### Takeaways

  * _Use visual connections._ Make the_ direction elements travel_ _cohesively _across the transition. Consider how moving a certain element adds clarity and to the transition.
  * _Direct user attention. _All moving elements should create a clear picture of where to look for the user. Direct user attention with coordinated, orderly motion.

### Delightful Details

The most basic use of animation is in _transitions_, but an app can truly delight a user when animation is used in ways beyond the standard scope of actions. It can exist within all components of an app and at all scales, from detailed icons to key transitions and actions.

#### Fun

Animations have the power to encourage users to actually interact. They can bring _empathy _in user experience and full of emotions.

#### **Animation for Animation's Sake**

Animation for animation's sake is (almost always) poor design. When an animation doesn't fit a functional purpose, it usually also feels awkward or annoying. Also keep longevity in mind -- will the animation get annoying on the 100th use, or is it universally clear and unobtrusive?

#### **Takeaway**

_Animating with purpose_. Rather than animating solely for the sake of delight, we should focus on practical things the animation does for the user.

### Conclusion

_Design with care_. Attention to each and every detail is key to your success making human-computer interaction easy to use. And thoughtful motion design can help us communicate much more effectively. The easier your product is for users to use, the more likely they'll be to use it.

Thank you!
