## **Mobile App Design Tip #1: Do Not Ignore Responsive Design**

Tablets and smartphones have very different screen sizes and are used in very different situations. For example, smartphones are often used when a user can only utilize one had to hold the phone and capture or manipulate data. Make sure you take responsive design and smaller screen size into account when doing mobile app design.

## ****Mobile App Design Tip #2: **Do Not Make the Screen too Busy**

As smartphone screens get larger, you may be tempted to add more to the app to utilize the bigger screen. This is not necessarily a good idea. Users want to get in and out of apps quickly to do business tasks. Don't make them get lost or hunt around for next steps. Help them get what and where they need, quickly.

## ****Mobile App Design Tip #3: **Do Not Be Inconsistent**

When designing a mobile app, keep a consistent layout throughout your mobile app. Use consistent toolbars, icons, colors and styles (rounded boxes or square boxes, for example. Keep the layout consistent -- if the toolbar for most screens is usually on the top, be careful about suddenly moving it to the bottom or the size of the screen. If your design becomes inconsistent, you risk confusing or frustrating a mobile app user with your design.

## ****Mobile App Design Tip #4: **Do Not Transfer your Design Directly from iOS to Android.**

Both iOS and Android are popular and heavily used, but a mobile app design that works well on one, may not work well on the other. Be sure to field test designs on EACH OS carefully before the hard launch.

## ****Mobile App Design Tip #5: Do Not Mix Fonts****
