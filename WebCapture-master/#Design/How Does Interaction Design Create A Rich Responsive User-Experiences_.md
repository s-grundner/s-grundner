In the form part of the UX Digital Transformation, interaction design has always been the most intangible design practice to work on.** New interaction design patterns emerge to support new technologies that keeps evolving in the digital space to caters the user needs.**

The fundamental of interaction persuades users to be more responsive by the messages on the website. **So how does can we define which interaction are suitable for our brand?** As simply put numerous interaction in our website can't be taken for granted in the future.

**Interaction design focus isn't to impress your users with how innovative your brand are. It's about Engagement.** With new functionality such as HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Motion Clips, and so on, the opportunity to create interactive digital experience are almost priceless. Engaging in the human connection and emotion, the focus of every interaction should moves users closer to completing their goal. Interaction design can be measured by: Y**our brand goals, web usability, functionality, consistency, learnability, and user feedbacks. Interaction design shows us how to respond and generate a conversation with every user in the digital environment.**

### Interaction Design Accessibility

One of the most challenging thing when designing experiences is to envision how the user behave in different platform, not just for one screen, but for all of them. Image carousel or a date picker isn't going to help your user flow sequence, if you don't understand the basic of choosing colors that works from a contrast combinations.** Building the accessible experience requires process time such as recognisable icons, success messages, and pop up transaction. The form of visual language you use to indicate success, needs to be reviewed in the early stage as soon as possible. Test with real people, Your Users!**

#### Responsive and adaptive environment is a larger push in this digital age:

  1. Parallax scrolling and effects VS push notifications and reminders of many pages
  2. Card-style layout to show articles VS Infinite scrolling
  3. Swipe or clicks or slide out or loops, fade in/fade out
  4. Hover effects as the secondary content VS Transitions loop between elements
  5. Scroll playlist to automatically start videos VS Visual static feedback form upon hover.
  6. and many other examples that you can think of…

Interaction design uses many tools and techniques to help us generate and identify potential solutions to the problems we need to solve. **We can start very low-tech with pencil, paper, sticky notes, and whiteboards, to help us reframe the idea from different point of views before start creating it digitally. Early communications will help us to identify the potential directions, informations, and the next steps to create delightful and captivating experiences.** In the creative industry, it's often called "Reshaping Navigation Interactions."

### Tap on Mobile Devices versus The Click of Websites

Through a series of steps, the traditional approach to navigation has helped people to locate and find the information or functionality the need. **But time has changed… Now, what brings content to us, is already connected in the form of direct path of relevance and meaningfulness. In the past, users have to keep clicking or scrolling each pages to browse the informations; Now, common digital touch point such as swiping, tapping, and zooming on the screens are no longer scarce experience;** Even in the future, we don't have to do anything, just say "Open Mailbox" will straight showing us contextually relevant action the moment we need it! (Thanks to Interaction Design)

### Understanding the Layers of Content

**Experiences taught us to avoid layers of content in the multiple windows. In the past, we used tabs instead of multiple windows to show different content of information.** It's not being used effectively because we have to go forward and going back on websites; moving up and down in the stacks of information. It confuse us when so many layers of information goes to different web page in multiple windows. **Luckily interaction design makes our lives much more easier… Now, we know how to open or close the layers, move it in or out the way where we were currently are. Interactive layers is the new engagement!**

The capabilities of interactive user experience is very beneficial when making unfamiliar devices feel instantly familiar. **The next big thing in interaction design is the connection between brand, human, and devices. It is personalized in the form of contextual experience to create a unique, shareable information.** **The need to do hard selling to persuade customers are long gone, interaction with users is what keeping us understand on what's happening, what are selling, and what are working. We want our product to work, the information delivered to engage users in the form of responsive possibilities of human connection and brand interactions.**

### The Underlying Page of Information Design

**In the UI/UX design, there are many questions and consideration that can serve as good springboards of building user flow. What's should be hidden/visible? What screens appeared and how it behave when it is closed? The key considerations is to ensure the design helps the users understanding the multiple layers of content without having to think so hard. Sometimes people need to be guided how to consume the functionality for the first time.** In the information testing, we should not just give our product and say, "Do whatever you want…" **To early adopters.**

Instead we should keep observing how to can we enhance our product better to design smarter interactive experience.

Don't force people to go looking for what we provide. Instead, help people to find content and functionality instantly when the need it. **Allow them to do interaction, navigating based on their own understanding, and creating rich experience with our brand based on their need.** Don't have to think so hard, as long as we are able to provide users with the engagement simple and effective animations can give tremendous help for our users through virtual experience.

### Interaction Design User Experience Techniques

  1. Animations & Interactive Graphics
  2. Transitions Infographics
  3. Layers of Informations by Connecting Elements
  4. Data Interface & Page Motion
  5. Photorealistic View
  6. Material Design
  7. And So on..

These techniques are the best practice nowadays. **However as digital experience is keep evolving, it is beneficial to think and act quickly. The best way to make sure we are moving ahead is to think ahead. Users are emotional creature, how they interact affect how we should allocate our information with their attention. How we understand it, and the decision we make should lead to engagement and best choices.** Not because we want to manipulate people with our product, but because we want to identify situations and opportunities that they might not aware by themselves.** It is very important to create the interfaces that help our users to make better decisions.**
