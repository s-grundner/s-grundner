This article is a walk trough of the 5 steps I use to design a website. I write this article primarily as a guide to myself so that I have my process written down to look up every time I start a new project, but also as a guide for others to follow. I learn something new in every project I work with, so this guide will probably change as I find better and more efficient ways to design websites.

Having a step by step guide to my process make me more productive and saves me a lot of time on my projects. Being a freelancer juggling several projects at the same time means my time is limited and it's crucial that I spend it wise. Having a step by step guide and sticking to it in a dedicated manner make me solve the riddles of design faster and more efficient.

### 1\. The client survey

The first step in my design process is to get as much information as possible from the client. The more I know about the clients needs, the less time I have to spend e-mailing or calling my client asking questions. So I'm better of doing it all before I even start thinking about how things are gonna look.

#### Listen to the client

Some clients don't know their own needs and some know exactly what they want. Some might even not care at all so this fase of the process is probably the most important as it will reveal the purpose and meaning of the whole project. So ask the client all the right questions to get your process going.

My preferred way of harvesting this kï¿½ind of information from the client is making them fill out a form that has all the questions I need answered to get my project going.

These are questions like: _What's the purpose of this website?, Who's the target audience?, Who are your competitors?, What actions do you want the users to take? Etc.._

My preferred way of collecting information from my clients is a simple form built in [Google forms](http://www.google.com/forms), If you are Norwegian speaking you can view my form by following this link: [Client survey](http://goo.gl/forms/WguHeJT22N)

I know that some of my clients are on the clock, so I keep the form short with no more than 15-20 questions to make sure that they have time to answer it, if I bomb the client with a 30 or 40 question form they might put it on hold and deprioritize it as it seems like a time consuming piece of work. So keep it short.

### Step 2: Research, ideas and sketching

This is the hardest step. I used to have the bad habit of jumping right into photoshop, that is probably the worst thing you can do and I can't stress enough how wrong that was for my process.

#### Sketching

The first tool I put to use in this part of the process is my personal notebook, if you don't have one, you should go get one right away. This is the number one tool for writing down all your ideas. Using pen and paper is the most efficient way to do brainstorming, you can note down and make small sketches whenever they pop up into your brain. Carry it with you at all time, that way you don't miss out on anything your brain may come up with. It doesn't mind if you suck at drawing, _(I really suck at drawing)_ because the sketches you make are entirely for your eyes only and a quick way to see what works and what don't. Start making little sketches of elements and just follow the flow.

#### Collect inspiration

In your favorite web browser make a bookmark folder and start collecting websites that have elements you like. Look for ideas on layouts and interactions, my goal with designing websites is not to reinvent the wheel, but to invent better wheels. Collecting ideas that others have done before you is a great way to find better ways to display content and find solutions to how the layout of your site might look. It's important that you only use these for inspiration and don't copy, copying is steeling, and steeling is wrong and just bad for your progress as a designer. Make your own stuff or choose another line of work.

#### Get to know your clients competitors

Research the competitors' websites. What do they all have in common? This you should include in your website even better. What is missing on their websites? This is where you could stick out from the crowd. Play the spy game and use the competitors' weaknesses for your own winning, and do it well. After all, you want your clients' website to be the best and the number one choice of your clients' potential customers.

### Step 3: Build wireframes

Now it's time to start placing elements, and I'm finally gonna give you permission to open up your favorite design tool. Mine used to be photoshop, but I recently moved to Adobe XD _(formerly known as Project Comet), _as it is a much more efficient and faster tool for making wireframes. Do every element in greyscale, I recommend you don't add any images or graphics at this stage. The purpose of a wireframe is to state where things go and your focus should entirely be on the layout of your site. Make a list of all the elements that should be included on the website and start placing them around in your wireframe. For fast wireframes I recommend pen and paper first, then a design tool. A wireframe is a nice starting point, that you later will build your website upon and it should define these elements:

#### Placement of elements

In a wireframe you decide where all the elements should go. At this stage you can also include your client to discuss what's the best placement of content.

#### Information hierarchy

By laying out all the pages as a sitemap you make it easier to get a visualization of the entire website. From here both you and your client can get a better view on how the website will be built up. This is where you decide how information will be given to the websites' visitors.

#### Building interactivity

Start making decisions on how elements are gonna interact with each other. The purpose of this is building the user experience and paving the path that we want the visitors to follow. This is where we should capture our prey and lead it to its' destiny. Example: We want the visitor to buy something or fill out a form, we should design the user experience in such way that the visitor gets tempted and get the feeling that this is the natural way to go, and doing so without having the visitor stop and speculate in where he should go next.

### Step 4. Creating a style guide

The next step in our process is making a style guide. I do this by making tiles that consists of the logo, typography, a color palette and a tone of voice. I try to catch the feel and the look of the website, I always include my client in this part of the process and discuss this back and forward until it's settled. The main reason I create a style guide is:

#### Turning concept into visual

I translate the mood, feeling and tone of my website based on what the client survey and discussions have given me.

#### Setting the rules

The style guide set the rules for how everything will look and feel, now I'm obligated to follow this set of rules when it comes to designing the prototype and I ensure that the design becomes consistent.

#### Saves me a ton of time

The style guide make it easy and fast to make changes if my client have requests and comments of my design. Instead of building the entire website and then make changes, these changes are already in effect before I start building the prototype.

### Step 5. Designing the prototype

The final step of my design process is building the prototype. Since I already have built a wireframe and made my style guide, I now have to combine these two together. A prototype is a model of the website, I always design my prototype pixel perfect so that everything looks exactly how it's gonna look when the website is finished. Now both me, and my client can see how the finished website is gonna be and feel.

#### User testing

I can use the prototype to test the interactivity and user experience. Testing will reveal how the site works for users and give me information about how the site meets my clients needs and expectations.

#### Make adjustments

Based on the answers from the user testing I now can do any required adjustments and improvements to the website. This step might be time consuming as every time I make adjustments and improvements I have to go back to user testing again, this goes around in a circles until everything meets the demands of the users and my client.

### That is my design process

The next step for me now is development. As I'm a hybrid that both design and code my websites, I do the development myself. That ensures me that nothing changes from the prototype to the finished online product.

I'm happy, the client is happy, and most important of all the users are happy!
